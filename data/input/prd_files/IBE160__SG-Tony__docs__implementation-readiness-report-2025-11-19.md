## Gap and Risk Analysis

### Critical Findings

**No critical gaps found that block implementation.**

All essential artifacts (PRD, Architecture, UX, Epics) are complete and aligned. The project is structurally ready for Phase 4.

### High Priority Concerns

**🟠 HIGH-1: Test Design Missing**

**Issue:** Test Design System workflow was recommended for BMad Method but not completed.

**Impact:**
- Missing system-level testability assessment (Controllability, Observability, Reliability)
- No proactive identification of hard-to-test architectural patterns
- Risk of discovering testability issues late in implementation
- May require refactoring if observability/controllability gaps found during development

**Recommendation:**
- Run `/bmad:bmm:workflows:test-design` before sprint planning
- OR add "System Testability Assessment" as first sprint story
- Focus on: Can we observe song generation failures? Can we control Suno API mocks for testing?

**Mitigation if Skipped:**
- Ensure Epic 1 includes logging/monitoring setup
- Add observability instrumentation to all API integrations early
- Plan for integration test strategy in sprint retrospective

---

**🟠 HIGH-2: Story-Level Detail Not Verified**

**Issue:** Epic files exist but story-level acceptance criteria and technical tasks not verified in this assessment.

**Context:**
- Epic index and summaries are comprehensive
- Individual epic markdown files reference story breakdowns
- However, this readiness check did not open and validate individual story detail

**Risk:**
- Stories may lack specific acceptance criteria (risk: unclear "done" definition)
- Technical tasks within stories may be too vague (risk: implementation uncertainty)
- Story sizing may be inconsistent (risk: sprint planning difficulty)

**Recommendation:**
- Review 2-3 representative stories from Epic 3 (core value prop) before sprint planning
- Verify acceptance criteria are testable and specific
- Confirm technical tasks provide sufficient implementation guidance
- Check story sizing (should be completable in 1-3 days each)

**Validation Checklist for Story Review:**
- [ ] Acceptance criteria written in Given/When/Then or clear bullet points?
- [ ] Technical tasks specific enough for AI agents to implement?
- [ ] Dependencies between stories explicitly noted?
- [ ] Story includes FR traceability reference?

---

**🟠 HIGH-3: Epic Sequencing Dependencies Not Explicit**

**Issue:** While logical epic order is clear (Foundation → Auth → Features), explicit dependency documentation not found.

**Observation:**
- Epic 1 (Foundation) obviously precedes all others
- Epic 2 (Auth & Credits) logically precedes Epic 3-6 (features requiring auth)
- But no explicit "Epic 2 MUST complete before Epic 3 starts" statements

**Risk:**
- Parallel development may violate dependencies (e.g., starting Epic 3 before Epic 2 auth complete)
- Sprint planning may schedule stories in wrong order
- Integration issues if infrastructure not ready

**Recommendation:**
- Add explicit dependency section to epic-summary.md or sprint planning doc:
  - **Epic 1** BLOCKS Epic 2-8 (foundation required)
  - **Epic 2** BLOCKS Epic 3-6 (auth/credits required for features)
  - **Epic 3, 4, 5** can run in parallel after Epic 1-2
  - **Epic 6** (Premium) can start after Epic 3 (song generation must work first)
  - **Epic 7** (UX/Help) can run anytime after Epic 1 (UI components)
  - **Epic 8** (Resilience) should be integrated throughout (not a final phase)

**Mitigation:**
- Sprint 1: Focus exclusively on Epic 1 (foundation)
- Sprint 2: Complete Epic 2 (auth/credits) before branching
- Sprint 3+: Parallel feature development safe

---

### Medium Priority Observations

**🟡 MED-1: Norwegian Pronunciation Quality Verification Plan Missing**

**Issue:** PRD states "Norwegian pronunciation quality is the ONLY irreplaceable value proposition" but no verification plan exists.

**Context:**
- Success criterion: "70% of users rate pronunciation as noticeably better than Suno alone"
- No documented plan for how to measure/validate pronunciation quality during development

**Recommendation:**
- Add story: "Pronunciation Quality Baseline Test" in Epic 3
  - Generate 10 Norwegian test songs with/without optimization
  - Have Norwegian speakers rate quality
  - Document baseline before shipping

**Risk if Skipped:**
- Ship product without validating core value prop
- Discover pronunciation doesn't actually improve after launch

---

**🟡 MED-2: API Cost Monitoring Not Explicitly in Epics**

**Issue:** Architecture mentions cost monitoring (FR62, FR67), but no explicit epic story for Vercel/Supabase/Suno cost alerting.

**Observation:**
- PRD specifies "System alerts founder when API costs exceed thresholds" (FR62)
- Architecture ADR-005 emphasizes pre-paid credit buffer for cost control
- Epic 8 (Resilience) likely covers this, but not explicitly verified

**Recommendation:**
- Verify Epic 8 includes story: "API Cost Monitoring Dashboard"
  - Daily cost tracking for Suno, OpenAI, Google APIs
  - Email alert if >$X per day threshold
  - Stripe revenue vs API cost burn rate visualization

**Risk if Missing:**
- Viral spike could cause unexpected costs
- No early warning if API pricing changes

---

**🟡 MED-3: 14-Day Auto-Deletion User Communication**

**Issue:** Architecture specifies 14-day song auto-deletion, PRD mentions user notification (FR48), but UX journey doesn't show notification UI.

**Gap:**
- FR48: "System notifies users before 14-day auto-deletion deadline"
- UX design doesn't specify when/how notification appears
- No mockup for "Your song will be deleted in 3 days" banner

**Recommendation:**
- Add UX pattern: "Warning banner on song list page" when songs <3 days from deletion
- Include in Epic 4 (Library Management) story checklist

**Risk if Skipped:**
- Users lose songs unexpectedly
- Negative reviews ("My songs disappeared!")

---

**🟡 MED-4: Mobile-First but Desktop Experience Underspecified**

**Issue:** UX is mobile-first (correct for target audience), but desktop experience less detailed.

**Observation:**
- UX specifies mobile breakpoint thoroughly (<640px)
- Desktop breakpoint (>1024px) mentions "side navigation" as option but not decided
- Responsive patterns defined but desktop layouts less visualized

**Recommendation:**
- Acceptable for MVP (primary users are mobile)
- Add desktop layout refinement in Sprint 2-3 after mobile core is solid

**Risk:** Low - Desktop is secondary use case

---

**🟡 MED-5: Error Message Copy Not Finalized**

**Issue:** Architecture specifies "user-friendly error messages" but actual copy not written.

**Examples from UX:**
- "Oops! Suno had a hiccup. Try again?" (good example provided)
- "Couldn't connect to Suno. Check your connection?" (good)
- But not all error scenarios have copy defined

**Recommendation:**
- Add story to Epic 7 (UX/Help): "Write error message copy for all failure scenarios"
- Include error code → user-friendly message mapping
- Test with non-technical users for clarity

**Risk:** Low - Can iterate on error copy post-MVP

---

### Low Priority Notes

**🟢 LOW-1: Vipps Payment Integration Deferred**

**Note:** PRD lists Vipps as "Post-MVP" (Growth phase). Architecture focuses on Stripe.

**Observation:** Correct prioritization. Stripe supports Norwegian market for MVP. Vipps can be added later based on user feedback.

**Action:** None required now. Revisit in Sprint Retrospective after MVP launch.

---

**🟢 LOW-2: Norwegian Language UI Deferred**

**Note:** UX currently English. PRD specifies Norwegian UI as "Post-MVP."

**Observation:** Acceptable for MVP given bilingual Norwegian market. English UI is standard for tech products in Norway.

**Action:** Track user feedback. If users request Norwegian UI, prioritize in backlog.

---

**🟢 LOW-3: Dark Mode Not Specified**

**Note:** UX color palette supports light mode. Dark mode not documented.

**Observation:** shadcn/ui supports dark mode out-of-box. Can be added post-MVP easily.

**Action:** Add as "nice-to-have" backlog item for future sprint.

---

## UX and Special Concerns

### UX Validation

**✅ UX-1: Core User Journey Completeness**

**Assessment:** All 4 critical user journeys fully documented with decision points and error recovery.

**Strengths:**
- Journey 1 (Fast Song Creation) targets 90% of users with <5 minute target (supports PRD <30 min goal)
- Journey 2 (Phonetic Optimization) serves 10% advanced users without complicating primary flow
- Journey 3 (Library Management) covers post-creation lifecycle
- Journey 4 (Onboarding) addresses first-time user activation (critical for 80% activation target)

**Validation:**
- ✅ All 70 FRs have UX coverage through journeys or components
- ✅ Error recovery paths documented ("API failure → Retry", "Insufficient credits → Buy Credits")
- ✅ Decision points clear ("Genre unknown? → Default to Popular")

---

**✅ UX-2: Pronunciation Optimization Transparency**

**Assessment:** Phonetic Diff Viewer component provides excellent transparency for core value prop.

**Strengths:**
- Split-screen before/after view shows exactly what changed
- Green highlighting makes phonetic transformations visible

- 48px+ touch targets specified (exceeds WCAG AAA 44px minimum)
- Keyboard navigation patterns defined for all interactive elements
- Screen reader support (ARIA labels, semantic HTML, live regions)
- Testing strategy includes Lighthouse, axe DevTools, manual testing

**Validation:**
- ✅ shadcn/ui components are accessible by default (Radix UI primitives)
- ✅ Form patterns include proper labels, error announcements
- ✅ Modal focus management prevents keyboard traps

**Recommendation:**
- Run Lighthouse accessibility audit after each sprint
- Target score >90 for all pages

---

**✅ UX-4: Mobile-First Design Rigor**

**Assessment:** Comprehensive mobile-first approach appropriate for target audience.

**Strengths:**
- Bottom navigation (always reachable with thumb)
- Horizontal genre carousel (familiar TikTok-style interaction)
- Full-screen creation flow minimizes distractions
- Touch-friendly targets (48px minimum)
- Native Web Share API for one-tap social sharing

**Validation:**
- ✅ Responsive breakpoints defined (<640px mobile, 640-1024px tablet, >1024px desktop)
- ✅ Adaptation patterns specified for navigation, carousels, modals
- ✅ Touch gestures (swipe, tap, drag) documented

**Observation:**
- Desktop experience less detailed but acceptable (mobile is primary)
- Can iterate desktop layouts post-MVP

---

**🟡 UX-5: Genre Carousel Implementation Complexity**

**Issue:** Genre Carousel is custom component with horizontal scroll, snap points, touch/drag/keyboard navigation.

**Complexity:**
- Non-trivial to implement (not standard shadcn/ui component)
- Must work smoothly on iOS Safari, Android Chrome, desktop browsers
- Requires touch event handling, momentum scrolling, snap alignment

**Recommendation:**
- Consider library: `embla-carousel-react` or `swiper`
- Or start with simpler grid view for MVP, add carousel in Sprint 2-3
- Test on real devices (iOS Safari often has quirks with touch/scroll)

**Risk:** Medium - If carousel feels janky, user experience degrades

**Mitigation:**
- Prototype carousel early in Sprint 1
- If too complex, fallback to vertical scrollable grid (still touch-friendly)

---

**✅ UX-6: Playful Nordic Color Theme Rationale**

**Assessment:** Color choice well-justified and appropriate for Norwegian market.

**Strengths:**
- Primary Red (#E94560) and Navy (#0F3460) evoke Norwegian flag without being literal
- Playful but professional (not toy-like)
- High contrast for mobile readability
- Accessible (WCAG AA ratios verified)

**Validation:**
- ✅ Emotional goal "Delighted & Amused" supported by warm coral-red, playful accents
- ✅ Credibility maintained by navy secondary color (trust, stability)

---

**✅ UX-7: Social Sharing Integration**

**Assessment:** One-tap sharing to TikTok, Facebook, Instagram well-designed.

**Strengths:**
- Native Web Share API (simplest implementation)
- Pre-filled caption with Musikkfabrikken attribution for viral growth
- Fallback: "Copy link" for platforms not supported by Share API

**Validation:**
- ✅ Supports FR56-59 (social sharing requirements)
- ✅ Watermark on free previews drives brand awareness (FR57)
- ✅ Share sheet component fully specified (UX Section 6.1)

**Recommendation:**
- Test Web Share API on iOS Safari, Android Chrome before launch (browser support varies)
- Have copy-link fallback ready

---

### Special Concerns

**🟢 GDPR Compliance**

**Assessment:** Architecture addresses GDPR for Norwegian market.

**Coverage:**
- Data retention: 14-day auto-deletion limits exposure
- User rights: Account deletion mentioned in architecture
- Privacy policy: Required (noted in architecture)

**Recommendation:** Add "Privacy Policy & Terms of Service" to Epic 1 (Foundation) legal requirements.

---

**🟢 API Dependency Resilience**

**Assessment:** Strong resilience patterns for third-party API dependencies.

**Strengths:**
- Retry logic with exponential backoff (architecture)
- Circuit breakers to disable features if APIs fail (architecture)
- Pre-paid credit buffer provides financial cushion (architecture ADR-005)
- Webhook + polling fallback for Suno (architecture ADR-007)

**Validation:**
- ✅ Epic 8 (System Resilience) covers error handling (FR66-70)
- ✅ Architecture documents all failure modes

---

**🟢 Founder Capacity - Manual Mastering**

**Assessment:** Mastering service scales to ~10-20 requests/week (architecture note).

**Observation:**
- Manual service is bottleneck but acceptable for MVP
- Architecture notes: "Post-MVP: Backup assistant when demand exceeds founder availability"

**Recommendation:** Monitor mastering request volume. If >10/week sustained, add backup assistant or automate.

## Positive Findings

### ✅ Well-Executed Areas

**🌟 Outstanding Areas:**

**1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**
- 8 ADRs with clear rationale, alternatives considered, consequences documented
- Decision-focused approach prevents AI agent conflicts (architecture purpose explicitly stated)
- ADR-005 (Pre-Paid Credits), ADR-006 (GPT-4 Pronunciation), ADR-007 (Async Generation) show deep thinking
- **Why This Matters:** Future developers (or AI agents) can understand WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT was decided

**2. First Implementation Command Provided**
- Architecture leads with exact command: `npx create-next-app@latest musikkfabrikken...`
- Epic 1 (Foundation) starts with same command
- Removes ambiguity for greenfield project start
- **Why This Matters:** Team can start Sprint 1 Story 1 immediately without guessing

**3. FR-to-Component Mapping Table**
- Architecture provides explicit table mapping all 70 FRs to implementation modules (architecture.md:173-186)
- Example: "Norwegian Pronunciation Optimization (FR9-13) → `/src/lib/phonetic/`, OpenAI integration"
- **Why This Matters:** Developers know exactly where to implement each requirement, AI agents can locate code consistently

**4. UX Journey Decision Points & Error Recovery**
- Every user journey includes "Decision Points" and "Error Recovery" sections
- Example: Journey 1 shows "API failure → Retry with credits preserved"
- **Why This Matters:** Prevents "happy path only" implementation, ensures resilience

**5. Traceability Throughout**
- PRD has 70 numbered FRs → Architecture maps FRs to components → Epics map FRs to stories → Traceability matrix exists
- Can answer "What story implements FR23?" or "What FR does this epic cover?"
- **Why This Matters:** No requirements get lost, can track test coverage back to requirements

**6. Scope Boundaries Explicit (MVP/Growth/Vision)**
- PRD clearly separates "What MUST work" (MVP) vs "Post-MVP" (Growth) vs "1-2+ years" (Vision)
- Prevents scope creep during implementation
- Example: Vipps payment clearly marked "Post-MVP"
- **Why This Matters:** Team won't waste time on "nice-to-haves" during Sprint 1-3

**7. Core Value Proposition Protection**
- PRD explicitly states: "Norwegian pronunciation quality is the ONLY irreplaceable value proposition. If this fails, the product fails."
- This clarity cascades: Architecture prioritizes GPT-4 integration, UX makes phonetic toggle prominent, Epic 3 is largest epic
- **Why This Matters:** Team knows what to protect during trade-off decisions

**8. Mobile-First Rigor**
- UX specifies 48px+ touch targets (exceeds WCAG AAA 44px)
- Bottom navigation, horizontal swipe carousel, full-screen creation flow all mobile-optimized
- **Why This Matters:** Matches actual user behavior (social media sharing from smartphones)

**9. Accessibility Not Afterthought**
- WCAG 2.1 AA target in PRD → UX verifies color contrast ratios → Architecture selects accessible component library (shadcn/ui)
- Testing strategy includes Lighthouse, axe DevTools, manual screen reader testing
- **Why This Matters:** Accessibility integrated from start (cheaper than retrofitting)

**10. Pre-Paid Credit Model Thoughtfulness**
- ADR-005 shows deep consideration of business model, API cost risk, user experience trade-offs
- Credit system protects against viral cost spikes while maintaining good UX
- **Why This Matters:** Sustainable business model embedded in architecture

---

**✅ Comprehensive Coverage:**

**1. Non-Functional Requirements Not Neglected**
- PRD dedicates full sections to Performance, Security, Scalability, Accessibility, Integration (not just functional features)
- Architecture addresses each NFR explicitly
- **Why This Matters:** Production-ready mindset, not just "make it work"

**2. Database Schema Includes RLS Policies**
- Not just table definitions - Row Level Security policies ensure multi-tenant data isolation
- Stored procedure (`deduct_credits()`) for atomic transactions shows attention to data integrity
- **Why This Matters:** Security and correctness baked into database layer

**3. Error Handling Strategy Throughout**
- PRD: FR66-70 (Error Handling & Resilience)
- Architecture: Try-catch patterns, error response format, retry logic, circuit breakers
- UX: Friendly error messages with recovery actions
- Epic 8: System Resilience dedicated epic
- **Why This Matters:** Resilience designed in, not patched on after launch

**4. Visual Documentation**
- UX provides interactive HTML visualizations (color themes, design directions)
- Not just text descriptions - users can see and interact with design options
- **Why This Matters:** Reduces misinterpretation, facilitates stakeholder buy-in

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

**Before Sprint Planning:**

**1. Address High Priority Concerns**
- ✅ **HP-1: Test Design** - Decide: Run test-design workflow OR add testability assessment as Sprint 1 story
- ✅ **HP-2: Story Detail** - Review 2-3 sample stories from Epic 3, verify acceptance criteria and technical tasks
- ✅ **HP-3: Epic Dependencies** - Document explicit dependency matrix (Epic 1 blocks all, Epic 2 blocks 3-6, etc.)

**2. Validate Epic Story Content**
- Open `docs/epics/epic-1-foundation-infrastructure.md` and verify story detail level
- Check acceptance criteria format: Given/When/Then or specific bullet points?
- Confirm technical tasks are implementation-ready
- If stories are placeholder outlines, run story elaboration before sprint planning

**3. Decide on Test Design Approach**
- **Option A (Recommended):** Run `/bmad:bmm:workflows:test-design` now (adds 1-2 hours, high value)
- **Option B:** Add "System Testability Assessment" as Sprint 1 Story 2 (after project initialization)
- **Option C:** Skip test design, rely on Epic 8 (Resilience) for observability (higher risk)

---

### Suggested Improvements

**For Sprint 1 Success:**

**1. Add Pronunciation Quality Baseline Story to Epic 3**
- Story: "Pronunciation Quality Baseline Test"
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Generate 10 test Norwegian songs (with/without phonetic optimization)
  - Have 3+ Norwegian speakers rate each on 1-5 scale
  - Document baseline scores and example transformations
  - Establish quality regression test dataset
- **Why:** Validates core value prop before shipping

**2. Add API Cost Monitoring to Epic 8**
- Story: "API Cost Monitoring Dashboard"
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Track daily costs for Suno ($0.06/song), OpenAI (~$0.03/request), Google Video (~$0.55/canvas)
  - Email alert if total daily cost exceeds $50 (configurable threshold)
  - Dashboard shows: Cost by service, Revenue (Stripe) vs API burn rate, Daily active users
- **Why:** Prevents viral cost spikes, early warning of pricing changes

**3. Add Deletion Warning UI to Epic 4**
- Story: "14-Day Deletion Warning Banner"
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Display warning banner on song library page when any song <3 days from auto-deletion
  - Banner text: "⚠️ [Song Name] will be deleted in X days. Download to keep forever."
  - "Download All" quick action button
  - Dismiss banner per-song (don't show again for this song)
- **Why:** Prevents user surprise, reduces negative reviews

**4. Prototype Genre Carousel Early**
- Sprint 1 Story: "Genre Carousel Proof-of-Concept"
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Horizontal scroll with 3-5 test genres
  - Snap-to-card alignment
  - Works on iOS Safari, Android Chrome, desktop Chrome
  - Smooth 60fps scrolling with touch/drag
  - If implementation too complex, document fallback (vertical grid)
- **Why:** High-risk custom component, validate feasibility early

---

**For Documentation Completeness:**

**5. Create Epic Dependency Matrix**
- Add section to `docs/epics/epic-summary.md` or create `docs/epics/epic-dependencies.md`:

```markdown
# Epic Dependencies

## Blocking Dependencies (Must Complete Before Others)
- **Epic 1** → BLOCKS → Epic 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (foundation required for all)
- **Epic 2** → BLOCKS → Epic 3, 4, 5, 6 (auth/credits required for features)

## Parallel Development (Can Work Simultaneously)
- **Epic 3, 4, 5** can parallelize after Epic 1-2 complete
- **Epic 7** (UX/Help) can start anytime after Epic 1 (UI framework ready)

## Integration Points
- **Epic 6** (Premium) should start after Epic 3 (song generation must work to test canvas/mastering)
- **Epic 8** (Resilience) should be integrated continuously, not saved for end
```

**6. Write Error Message Copy**
- Add to Epic 7: Story "Error Message Copy Specification"
- Create file: `docs/error-messages.md` mapping error codes to user-friendly messages
- Examples:
  - `SUNO_API_TIMEOUT` → "Suno is taking longer than usual. Hang tight, or try again in a minute."
  - `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` → "You need 10 credits to generate a song. Buy more credits?"
  - `PHONETIC_OPTIMIZATION_FAILED` → "Couldn't optimize pronunciation. Generate without optimization?"

---

   - Sprint 3-4: Core song creation (Epic 3) - highest priority
   - Sprint 5+: Library, Social, Premium (Epic 4, 5, 6)

### Readiness Rationale

**Why "Ready with Conditions" (not "Ready"):**
- Test Design workflow was recommended for BMad Method but not completed (testability unknown)
- Story-level detail not verified in this assessment (acceptance criteria may need elaboration)
- Epic dependencies not explicitly documented (risk of out-of-order implementation)

**Why "Ready with Conditions" (not "Not Ready"):**
- All critical artifacts exist and are of excellent quality
- Gaps are procedural (process steps), not structural (missing requirements or design)
- Conditions can be addressed in 1-2 hours before sprint planning
- Core planning is solid - conditions are about execution setup

**Comparison to BMM Standard:**
For BMad Method greenfield projects, expected artifacts are:
- ✅ PRD (Complete, 70 FRs)
- ✅ UX Design (Complete, 1,071 lines)
- ✅ Architecture (Complete, 1,314 lines with ADRs)
- ✅ Epic Breakdown (Complete, 8 epics with traceability)
- ⚠️ Test Design (Recommended, not found)

**4 of 5 expected artifacts complete = Strong readiness, conditions addressable.**

### Conditions for Proceeding (if applicable)

**Pre-Sprint Planning (Required):**
1. ✅ **Verify Story Detail** - Open 2-3 stories from Epic 3, confirm acceptance criteria and technical tasks are specific
2. ✅ **Document Epic Dependencies** - Create epic-dependencies.md with blocking/parallel relationships
3. ✅ **Decide Test Design** - Choose: Run workflow now, add Sprint 1 story, or skip with awareness

**Sprint 1 Additions (Recommended):**
4. ✅ **Add Testability Assessment** - If skipping test-design workflow, add as Story 1.4
5. ✅ **Add Carousel Prototype** - Story 1.5 to validate high-risk custom component early

**Backlog Additions (Recommended):**
6. ✅ **Add Pronunciation Quality Test** - Epic 3 story to validate core value prop
7. ✅ **Add Cost Monitoring** - Epic 8 story to prevent API cost surprises
8. ✅ **Add Deletion Warning** - Epic 4 story to improve user experience

**If All Conditions Met:**
- **Status becomes:** ✅ **READY** (no qualifications)
- **Proceed to:** Sprint Planning workflow (`/bmad:bmm:workflows:sprint-planning`)

### C. Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Risk: Test Design Not Completed**
- **Impact:** Testability issues discovered late in implementation
- **Probability:** Medium (BMM recommends test design for complex projects)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Run `/bmad:bmm:workflows:test-design` before sprint planning (1-2 hours)
  - OR add "System Testability Assessment" as Sprint 1 story
  - Focus: Observability (logging), Controllability (API mocking), Reliability (flaky tests)

**Risk: Story Acceptance Criteria Insufficient**
- **Impact:** Unclear "done" definition, rework during sprint
- **Probability:** Low-Medium (epic summaries look good, but detail not verified)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Review 2-3 sample stories from Epic 3 before sprint planning
  - Enforce acceptance criteria format: Given/When/Then OR specific testable bullets
  - Use Definition of Done checklist per story

**Risk: Epic Dependencies Not Respected**
- **Impact:** Feature development starts before infrastructure ready, integration failures
- **Probability:** Medium (dependencies logical but not explicitly documented)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Create epic-dependencies.md with blocking relationships
  - Sprint planning enforces sequencing (Epic 1 → 2 → 3-6)
  - Code review checks: "Does this story depend on incomplete epic?"

**Risk: Norwegian Pronunciation Quality Doesn't Improve**
- **Impact:** Core value prop fails, product fails
- **Probability:** Low (founder has 80k listener validation)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Add "Pronunciation Quality Baseline Test" story to Epic 3
  - Generate test songs with/without optimization, have Norwegian speakers rate
  - Iterate on GPT-4 prompts before launch if quality insufficient

**Risk: API Cost Spike from Viral Growth**
- **Impact:** Unexpected costs, financial unsustainability
- **Probability:** Medium (viral potential, but pre-paid credit buffer helps)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Add "API Cost Monitoring Dashboard" to Epic 8
  - Set daily cost alerts ($50 threshold initially)
  - Pre-paid credit model provides revenue buffer before costs incurred

**Risk: Genre Carousel Implementation Too Complex**
- **Impact:** Janky UX, poor user experience for core interaction
- **Probability:** Medium (custom component, touch/scroll tricky on mobile)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Prototype carousel in Sprint 1 (Genre Carousel Proof-of-Concept story)
  - Consider library (`embla-carousel-react`) instead of custom implementation
  - Fallback: Simpler vertical grid view if carousel too complex

**Risk: 14-Day Auto-Deletion Causes User Frustration**
- **Impact:** Negative reviews, lost songs, user churn
- **Probability:** Medium (users may forget about 14-day policy)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Add "14-Day Deletion Warning Banner" to Epic 4
  - Display warning when songs <3 days from deletion
  - "Download All" quick action for easy backup
