# Product Brief: BookHelper

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Author:** Alex
**Status:** Draft for PM Review

---

## Executive Summary

**BookHelper** is an automated reading infrastructure platform designed to solve the critical gaps faced by privacy-conscious readers transitioning from proprietary ecosystems (Amazon Kindle/Audible) to open-source alternatives (KOReader, self-hosted tools).

**The Problem:** Users migrating to open-source reading tools face three interconnected challenges: (1) years of historical reading data trapped in proprietary formats with no migration path, (2) valuable reading statistics at risk due to lack of automated backup, and (3) significant manual overhead for library management, metadata enrichment, and cross-device synchronization. Current solutions force users to choose between vendor lock-in and unsustainable time investment.

**The Solution:** BookHelper provides automated infrastructure across three domains: (1) one-time historical data migration from Kindle/Audible into KOReader-compatible format, (2) continuous automated backup of reading statistics to resilient cloud storage with unified database for analytics, and (3) zero-touch library management including auto-metadata enrichment, format optimization, and cross-device sync.

**Target Market:** Privacy-conscious, technically proficient readers (20+ books/year) who value data ownership, detailed reading statistics, and automation. Primary user is the product owner (self-use MVP), with potential future expansion to broader open-source reading community.

**Key Value Proposition:** Eliminate 95%+ of manual library management overhead while preserving complete reading history and enabling future analytics capabilities—all using free, open-source tools with zero ongoing costs. Users gain data sovereignty, automated workflows, and foundation for AI-powered reading insights without sacrificing privacy or investing in commercial platforms.

**MVP Success Criteria:** Complete historical data migration with zero corruption, automated library ingestion in <30 seconds per book, 99%+ backup uptime, and accessible unified database combining ebook + audiobook statistics across complete reading timeline.

## Problem Statement

Users transitioning from proprietary reading ecosystems (Amazon Kindle/Audible) to open-source alternatives face three critical, interconnected problems that prevent them from fully owning and leveraging their reading data:

**1. Historical Data Loss and Fragmentation**
- Years of reading history locked in proprietary formats (Kindle, Audible) cannot transfer to new tools
- Reading statistics, progress tracking, and behavioral data are siloed across incompatible platforms
- No path exists to consolidate historical ebook and audiobook data into a unified timeline

**2. Data Vulnerability and Backup Gaps**
- Reading statistics files (KOReader's statistics.sqlite3) are stored locally with no automated backup strategy
- Risk of catastrophic data loss from device failure, corruption, or accidental deletion
- No reliable cloud sync solution validated for cross-device access and disaster recovery
- Library files stored on single PC create single point of failure

**3. Manual Library Management Friction**
- Ebook ingestion requires manual steps: download → metadata lookup → format fixing → device transfer
- No automated workflow for metadata enrichment, cover art retrieval, or format standardization
- Library access limited to home network; remote access requires manual VPN/configuration
- Cross-device synchronization (iOS, Boox Palma 2) relies on fragile manual processes
- Audiobook tooling (BookPlayer) provides inconsistent sync with reading platforms (Hardcover.app)

**Quantifiable Impact:**
- Risk of losing 2+ years of detailed reading statistics representing hundreds of hours of reading activity
- 15-30 minutes per book spent on manual metadata management and device transfers
- No consolidated view of reading patterns across ebooks and audiobooks, preventing data-driven reading habit optimization
- Inability to perform historical analysis or trend identification across reading history

**Why This Matters Now:**
Having successfully transitioned away from Amazon's ecosystem to privacy-focused alternatives (Boox Palma 2 + KOReader), the infrastructure gaps are now critical blockers. Without automated solutions, continuing to read means either accepting ongoing manual overhead or risking permanent loss of valuable historical data. The window to migrate Kindle/Audible history is now—before data exports become stale or unavailable—and the daily friction of manual library management is unsustainable for long-term use.

---

## Proposed Solution

BookHelper is an automated reading infrastructure platform that unifies, protects, and enhances the open-source reading experience through three integrated capabilities:

**1. Historical Data Migration Engine with Hardcover Reconciliation**
- One-time data pipeline that ingests Kindle and Audible historical data exports
- Transforms proprietary formats into KOReader-compatible statistics.sqlite3 entries
- Reconciles and validates migrated data against Hardcover.app (primary source of truth for reading records)
- Handles books present in Hardcover but not in Kindle/Audible exports (e.g., Hoopla imports, Goodreads orphans) with graceful fallback to available metadata
- Preserves reading timeline continuity while maintaining database integrity for ongoing KOReader use
- Ensures overlapping fields match across all sources (Kindle, Audible, Hardcover, KOReader)

**2. Automated Backup, Hardcover Integration, and Unified Database**
- Continuous synchronization of reading statistics (ebooks + audiobooks) to resilient cloud storage
- Deep Hardcover.app API integration as primary source for book metadata and reading habit data
- Hardcover as system of record for ratings, annotations, and notes (non-negotiable)
- Centralized database (e.g., Supabase) consolidating all reading data with accessible API layer
- Research-validated backup strategy for KOReader statistics (cloud sync vs. alternative approaches)
- Automated conflict resolution and data merging across devices
- Future-ready data model supporting analytics, visualization, and AI-powered insights

**3. Automated Library Management System with Priority on Metadata Automation**
- Zero-touch ebook ingestion: drop files → auto-metadata enrichment (via Hardcover API) → format optimization → device sync
- Self-hosted library server (Calibre-Web-Automated or validated alternative) with remote access
- Cross-device availability (iOS Readest, Boox Palma 2 KOReader) via local and internet access
- Unified library system supporting both ebooks and audiobooks (separate only if unified solution unavailable; metadata automation prioritized)
- Automated backup separate from primary PC to prevent data loss
- Syncthing integration for seamless file synchronization

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Data Sovereignty:** Complete ownership and control of all personal reading data
- **Hardcover-Centric:** Hardcover.app serves as system of record for ratings, metadata, and reading behavior insights
- **Ecosystem Agnostic:** Works across proprietary legacy data (Kindle/Audible) and open-source tools (KOReader)
- **Zero Manual Overhead:** Automation eliminates repetitive metadata and sync tasks via intelligent API integration
- **Analytics Foundation:** Database architecture designed for future statistical analysis and AI integration, powered by comprehensive Hardcover data
- **Resilience First:** Multiple backup layers and fault-tolerant infrastructure prevent data loss

**Why This Will Succeed:**
BookHelper solves immediate pain points from transitioning to open-source reading tools (data loss risk, manual overhead) while establishing infrastructure for future personal reading analytics. The solution leverages existing tools and data (Hardcover.app, KOReader, Kindle/Audible exports) to create an automated, resilient system that enables a reading habit that would otherwise require unsustainable manual effort or compromise privacy with commercial platforms.

- **Ebook files** (server + Boox) - Master library on RPi, synced copy on device
- **Audiobook files** (iOS only) - Manual management via BookPlayer

**2. Sync & Backup Layer (Corruption-Safe Design):**

**Progress Sync (Application-Aware, Live Data):**
- **KOReader ↔ Readest:** CWA KOSync server (self-hosted, database protocol, NOT file sync)
- **KOReader → Hardcover:** hardcoverapp.koplugin (updates reading progress via API)
- **BookPlayer → Hardcover:** Native BookPlayer sync (manual trigger, updates listening progress)

**File Sync (Ebook Library):**
- **Server → Boox:** Syncthing "Send Only" from RPi, "Receive Only" on Palma (one-way library distribution)
- **Server → iOS:** OPDS protocol (on-demand download via Readest, NO background file sync)

**Disaster Recovery Backup (One-Way, Versioned):**
- **Statistics Backup:** Syncthing "Send Only" from Boox → RPi `statistics.sqlite3` copy (disaster recovery only)
- **Library Backup:** rclone encrypted → Koofr (nightly sync of ebook library + CWA configs)
- **⚠️ CRITICAL:** Statistics backup is one-way ONLY - server never writes back to device (prevents corruption)

**3. Library Management Layer:**
- **Ingestion:** CWA auto-ingest (folder monitoring → Calibre import → metadata enrichment)
- **Metadata:** Hardcover.app provider (primary), Google Books fallback, manual editing via CWA web UI
- **Format Optimization:** CWA epub fixer, Calibre conversion engine
- **OPDS Catalog:** CWA OPDS feed for Readest iOS access

**4. Access Layer:**
- **Local Network:** Direct access to RPi services (CWA web UI, OPDS, KOSync)
- **Remote Access:** Tailscale mesh VPN (all devices, zero-config, private 100.x.x.x network)
- **Web UI:** CWA responsive web interface (library browsing, metadata editing)
- **Device Clients:** KOReader (Boox), Readest (iOS) via OPDS + KOSync

**5. Analytics Layer (MVP Scope):**
- **ETL Pipeline:** Nightly Python script (statistics.sqlite3 → transform → Neon.tech)
- **Data Warehouse:** Neon.tech PostgreSQL (ebook sessions, page timing, reading velocity)
- **Query Access:** Direct SQL queries via PostgreSQL clients (DBeaver, pgAdmin, psql)
- **Future:** Grafana dashboards, AI-powered insights (Phase 2)

### ⚠️ Critical Warnings & Risk Mitigation

**CRITICAL WARNING: SQLite Corruption Risk**

All three research documents unanimously identify **file-level sync of live SQLite databases as the #1 cause of catastrophic data loss**. This architecture implements mandatory safeguards:

**The Problem:**
- KOReader's `statistics.sqlite3` is a live database with frequent write operations
- File-level sync tools (Syncthing, Dropbox, Google Drive) copy files at the filesystem level
- If sync occurs during a database write transaction, the copied file contains a "torn write"
- Result: **Corrupted database = total, irreversible loss of all reading history**

**Mandatory Architecture Requirements (Non-Negotiable):**

1. **✅ Progress Sync MUST use application-aware protocols:**
   - CWA KOSync server (database-aware, handles transactions correctly)
   - KOReader hardcoverapp.koplugin (uses Hardcover API, not file sync)
   - **NEVER** use Syncthing, Dropbox, or any file-level tool for progress sync

2. **✅ Statistics Backup MUST be one-way:**
   - Syncthing configured as "Send Only" from Boox Palma to RPi
   - Device is ALWAYS source of truth
   - Server NEVER writes back to device (prevents conflicts and corruption)
   - This is disaster recovery only, NOT for progress sync

3. **✅ Separation of concerns is MANDATORY:**
   - **Live Progress Sync:** KOSync (application-aware, real-time)
   - **Disaster Recovery:** Syncthing one-way backup (file-level, scheduled)
   - These two functions MUST NEVER be mixed

**Consequences of Violation:**
- **Immediate:** Database becomes unreadable ("malformed database" errors)
- **Data Loss:** 100% of reading history lost (unrecoverable)
- **No Warning:** Corruption is silent until database is accessed
- **Research Consensus:** This is the most common cause of user data loss

**Validation Steps (Must perform during setup):**
1. Verify Syncthing folders configured as "Send Only" (Boox) and "Receive Only" (RPi)
2. Verify KOSync is configured and working independently
3. Never configure Syncthing to sync the KOReader settings folder in both directions
4. Test disaster recovery: Manually corrupt backup copy, verify device database unaffected

**Known Risk: CWA Ingest Stability**

**Research Finding:** Former CWA contributor describes auto-ingest as:
- "A hack built on Calibre's destructive import process"
- "Bound to break eventually"
- "Subpar metadata fetching compared to raw Calibre"

**Risk Level:** Medium
**Impact if Fails:** Ingest stops working, manual Calibre CLI intervention required
**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Monitor CWA logs for ingest errors
2. Keep Calibre CLI tools installed on server as fallback
3. Maintain manual ingest procedure documentation
4. Test ingest with non-critical books first
5. Backup metadata.db before bulk imports

**Acceptance Criteria:** Features (KOSync, auto-ingest, Hardcover metadata) outweigh stability risk for MVP. If ingest breaks, fallback to Calibre CLI preprocessing exists.

---

**Resource Constraint: RPi 4 2GB**

**Current Headroom:** ~750-1000MB buffer with ebook-only CWA stack
**Risk Scenario:** Memory pressure during large library scans or metadata processing

**Monitoring Plan:**
- Set up system monitoring (htop, docker stats)
- Monitor during first large library import
- Watch for OOM killer activity in system logs

**Escalation Plan:**
1. If crashes occur: Add 2GB USB swap file (degrades performance but prevents crashes)
2. If persistent: Upgrade to RPi 5 4GB or 8GB
3. If adding Audiobookshelf later: Hardware upgrade required

**Current Status:** ✅ Validated sufficient for ebook-only workload per research

---

**Hardcover.app API Dependencies**

**Components Relying on Hardcover:**
- CWA metadata provider (ebook metadata enrichment)
- hardcoverapp.koplugin (ebook progress sync)
- BookPlayer (audiobook progress sync)

**Risk:** Hardcover.app API changes or becomes unavailable
**Impact:** Metadata enrichment breaks, progress sync to Hardcover stops
**Mitigation:**
- CWA has fallback metadata providers (Google Books, Open Library)
- Local reading stats (statistics.sqlite3, Neon.tech) unaffected
- Hardcover provides reading timeline, but is not critical infrastructure

**Acceptance:** Low risk - Hardcover is actively maintained, has large user base, provides migration tools

### Integration Points & Data Flow

**External Service Integrations:**
- **Hardcover.app GraphQL API:**
  - CWA metadata provider (ebook metadata enrichment during ingest)
  - hardcoverapp.koplugin (ebook reading progress updates via API)
  - BookPlayer native sync (audiobook listening progress)
  - Optional: ETL enrichment queries for Neon.tech analytics

**Device Integration Protocols:**
- **KOSync Protocol:** CWA server ↔ KOReader (Boox) ↔ Readest (iOS) - bidirectional progress sync
- **OPDS Protocol:** CWA server → Readest (iOS) - on-demand ebook downloads
- **Syncthing Protocol:**
  - Library sync: RPi → Boox Palma (one-way, "Receive Only" on device)
  - Statistics backup: Boox Palma → RPi (one-way, "Send Only" from device)

**Data Export/Migration (One-Time, Future Epics):**
- Kindle historical data export → KOReader statistics format (Epic 1)
- Audible historical data export → unified database (Epic 1)
- Hardcover API as reconciliation source for migration validation
