_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 1**_

### **1. Introduction**

#### **1.1 Purpose**


The present document is a software requirements specification document for PeaZip,
version 2.7.1. PeaZip is a general purpose file and archive manager application for a computer
system, aiming to provide a cross-platform graphical interface for many Open Source archiving and
compression utilities, so that its user would be able to handle most of the available archiving
formats(indicatively: 7z,RAR,ZIP. Full list of the supported formats is provided in following
chapters).

This document follows “Software Requirements Specification” template for software
requirements specification documents, by Karl E. Wiegers, with a few declensions.

#### **1.2 Document Conventions**


The present document concerns software engineers that would work on further
development of this piece of software, as well as clients/users of PeaZip.

This is the only document so far describing PeaZip’s software requirements. It should be
used by software engineers who will develop this piece of software and it should be used for
formalization of the software that is going to be delivered to clients/users. Every future change in
the requirements of this software should be made through a typical procedure of change and final
acceptance of this document.

Software engineers should ask for further explanation or clarification, if and wherever they
decide this is necessary and should not proceed to modifications without the approval of the final
client/user.

#### **1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions**


This document applies to programmers of this project, to software engineers that weal work
on its further development and, finally, to the end users of this application and it aims at displaying
the features of PeaZip version 2.7.1, as well as at providing information about the goals and the
proper use of the software.

Chapters that would interest users are: 3, 4 and 6, whereas the whole document would be
of interest for software engineers and programmers.

#### **1.4 Project Scope**


The piece of software to which the present document refers, is a file and archive manager
application for a computer system, that offers user the capability of archiving,compressing and
extracting (decompressing) files and archives.

In brief, the basic functions that PeaZip features are:


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 2**_


Creating compressed archives, updating compressed archives, extracting content of compressed
archives, file and archive management tools(robust copy, split and join, fast or secure deletion,
byte to byte comparison, calculation of a wide set of checksums and hashes over selected files),
append timestamp to archive name(useful for archiving and backup purpose) and two factor
authentication(password and keyfile) for the managed archives. All pre-mentioned functions’
parameters can be modified and adapted to user’s needs and preferences from a settings’ menu.

The initial goal of this application was creating a frontend for Pea archiving utility. However,
after completing PeaZip’s GUI, support to many mainstream archiving and compression formats
was added to PeaZip. In this way, PeaZip became an aggregate frontend GUI for a set of Open
Source archiving and compression utilities(full list of which is provided in following chapters). The
fact that this application is Open Source software, gives its users the chance to directly take part in
its development, as well as notice possible bugs or mistakes and make their suggestions on it.

This is a picture of PeaZip:

_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 3**_

### **2. Overall Description**

#### **2.1 Product Perspective**


Peazip was created for file and archive management in a computer system. The initial goal
of the application was to function as frontend for Pea archiving utility(which was also developed by
PeaZip’s creator, Giorgio Tani). However, after completing the development of PeaZip UI, support
to more archiving and compression formats (full list of which is provided in following chapters) was
added to PeaZip, allowing it to function as a single, consistent frontend GUI, which exposes a list
of options of the underlying applications.


PeaZip works similarly to a large group of well-known applications, like WinRAR and
WinZip. PeaZip features, to a large degree, the same features with the applications of this group
and in addition, it supports a wide range of archiving and compression formats(superset of the
supported by each application of the pre-mentioned group set)as well as some file and archive
management tools(which are mentioned explicitly in following chapters), while at the same time it
offers its users the capability of executing its functions as command prompt commands(resulting
commands can be extracted and saved in a text file), allowing them to monitor any running activity
in real-time.

An important attribute of PeaZip is its self-standingness and its independency from the kind
of the Operating System of the computer system on which it runs. In no case is the installation of
any other program required for PeaZip to work, while for cases that no system integration is
preferred, PeaZip Portable is available as standalone application, not needing installation and not
modifying the host system.

3. Settings window (Settings interface).

#### **2.2 Product Features**


PeaZip is a general purpose file and archive manager application for a computer system,
aiming to provide a cross-platform graphical interface for many Open Source archiving and
compression utilities. The most important features that are offered by those utilities, through
PeaZip, are the following:

  - Creating archives in any of the supported archiving and compression formats(full list of
which is provided in following chapters)

  - Updating an already existing archive

  - Appending timestamp with date and time on the managed archive name for archiving and
backup purpose

  - Two factor (password and keyfile) authentication for the managed files and archives

  - Extracting contents of any compressed in any of the supported archiving and compression
formats (full list of which is provided in following chapters) archive

  - Secure file and archive deletion from any storing unit of the computer system on which
PeaZip runs

  - Byte to byte comparison between tow files

  - Check files in order to find duplicate files and to check files for corruption

  - Splitting files and merging split volumes back to original file

  - Information list, which lists contend of selected files/archives. In info mode, it shows number
of files and archives, newer and older object’s date/time of last modification, total space
occupation and larger and smaller object’s size

  - View content of a file or archive represented as hexadecimal values

  - Graphical monitoring of all executed functions


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 5**_


All functions above can be modified and adapted to users’ preferences through a settings
menu. Moreover, any of those features can be executed as command prompt command. Finally,
more than one of those features can be applied to a single archive or file.

#### **2.3 User Classes and Characteristics**


This software applies to any user of any computer system. There is no limitation on who
would be able to or allowed to use PeaZip, as PeaZip is an application that could be used by any
user of a computer system who would like to manage (archiving and compression) files and
archives of the system.

PeaZip users can be divided into two main categories: to the ones that have already used
an archiving and compression application and to all the rest. Even though PeaZip functions are
relatively simple and PeaZip’s interface is pleasant and user friendly, users included in both
categories, should read the tutorials and help documents that have been written about the
particular application(and are either available in sites that are mentioned in following chapter or
inside the application), so as to inform themselves on the application scope and needs that it
covers, as well as to be able to use in full extend all, featured by the application, functions..

Another distinction of PeaZip users in categories, could be made according to user’s
experience and knowledge on using computer systems. In this case, however, the distinction into a
discrete number of categories is not easy, because it is not possible to put unambiguous boarders
between categories according to users’ experience and knowledge level on using computer
systems, as it is a non-countable amount. Still, in general, it could be claimed that users with larger
experience and knowledge on using computer systems, could use more easily some advanced
features offered by PeaZip, such as executing its function in command prompt.

#### **2.4 Operating Environment**


As far as operating systems are concerned PeaZip is compatible with:

  - All 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows
ΝΤ Χ

  - All 32-bit Microsoft Windows(95/98/ /2000/ P/Vista)

  - All POSIX(all versions of Linux/all versions of BSD/all UNIX-like operating systems)

Moreover, PeaZip is available as source code that is compatible with almost any operating system.
It is obvious, that PeaZip is independent from the operating system of the computer system on
which it runs.

As far as hardware is concerned, PeaZip requires an x-86 compatible CPU, due to some
performance critical sections written in ASM. In general, CPU and RAM requisites of PeaZip, are
bound to the chosen algorithm and compression level, ranging from a few KB for simpler
algorithms (like when storing files in tar/gz/zip formats) to above than a GB for more complex
algorithms and higher compression level (like LZMA, PPMd and PAQ). Needless to say, it is the
choice of the compression algorithm that is the most important factor that determines the job's
speed, even if usually more advanced algorithms are the ones that scale better in performances in
multi-core environments.

To conclude, as far as software is concerned, all needed software invoked by the frontend
is included in PeaZip packages (available under suitable licenses, as open source or royalty free)
so no custom package is needed to be installed to make PeaZip work (with the possible exception


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 6**_


of some standard gtk/gdk related libraries needed to run PeaZip, Gwrap and Pea binaries, which
may be missing in some computer systems, but are well known, trustable and widely available).

#### **2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints**


Should anyone wish to work on further development of PeaZip knowledge in any of the
following programming languages is required:

  - Delphi/Kylix

  - Object Pascal

  - Pascal

This software’s license is LGPL, which mean that PeaZip is 100% Open Source and 100% free
and it can be used be linked to any other software regardless of whether it is free software or
proprietary software. Everyone that does or is going to develop or use PeaZip, should agree and
fully accept the terms of this kind of license.

Moreover, PeaZip is developed under the development environment Lazarus
IDE(http://sourceforge.net/projects/lazarus/).

#### **2.6 User Documentation**


Users can find help relevant to installing and using PeaZip in the Help Document (PeaZip
Help – Revision: 14/10/2009) and in Mini Tutorial that are both included in the application, as well
as in the following Internet addresses:

  - http://peazip.sourceforge.net/index.html

  - ~~http://peazip.sourceforge.net/peazip-hel~~ p.html

#### **2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies**


Do not exist.

### **3. System Features**


In this chapter, functional requirements of the application and the features it provides are
presented. PeaZip is a file and archive manager application for a computer system that allows
users to compress/decompress, authenticate and archive them. All PeaZip’s features are
explicated in the following units.

#### **3.1 System Feature 1**


Browsing areas and objects of the computer system.


**3.1.1** **Description and Priority**


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 7**_


PeaZip’s users can browse and gain access, in various ways, to every area (e.g.
storing units, desktop, users documents etc) of the computer system on which
PeaZip runs, as well as to included objects (archives and files).
**3.1.2** **Stimulus/Response Sequences**

In the initial window of the application (which is also going to be mentioned as file
manager interface) there is a button writing “File” on it. By pressing this particular
button, opens a submenu with choices that have to do with browsing and access to
areas and objects of the computer systems


4. Browsing submenu


More specifically:
By choosing “Filesystem”, users can get access to an object from an object list of
objects that is organized according to a functional hierarchy..
By choosing “Bookmarks”, users can get access to an object from a list of objects
that have been rated by them as favorites.
By choosing “Recent archives”, users can get access to an object from a list of
objects that have been recently browsed in PeaZip.
Finally, through “Open path” and “Open archive”, users can get direct access to a
path of an object or a file/archive.
Moreover, browsing and access to computer system’s objects is provided by
navigation bar of the file manager interface, with navigation buttons (back, forward,
up) and refresh button.


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 8**_


By this feature, users are allowed to search and gain access to objects they would
like to manage.
**3.1.3** **Functional Requirements**

Installation of no other application is required, for PeaZip to manage this function.
The only functional requirement is:
REQ-1: Operating system on the computer system.

#### **3.2 System Feature 2**


Variety of ways of selection of displayed in file manager interface objects.


**3.2.1** **Description and priority**

Users are allowed to manage the way of selection of the displayed in file manager
interface objects(files and archives).
**3.2.2** **Stimulus/Response Sequences**

In the initial window of the application(file manager interface), there is a button writing
“Edit” on it. By pressing this particular button, opens a submenu with choices that
have to do with altering ways of selection of files displayed currently at file manager
interface.


5. Selection submenu.


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 9**_


More specifically:
“Select all”, selects all objects that are currently displayed at file mager interface.
“Invert selection”, allows inverted selection of objects(this means that all nonselected before the beginning of the function objects are selected and all selected
before the beginning of the function objects are deselected).
“All objects…” set of commands, allows selection from the objects displayed on file
manager interface, according to: extension, attributes, size and date..
Finally, “Sort by selection status”, sorts all objects on file manager interface
according to whether they are selected or not.
With this feature users are allowed to flexibly alternate the way of selection of
currently displayed objects on file manager interface. This feature is particularly
useful for object selection for mass management, especially when the number of
currently displayed objects on file manager interface is large (thus manual selection
object-by-object could lead to errors).
**3.2.3** **Functional Requirements**

Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System
Feature 1.

#### **3.3 System Feature 3**


Accessibility to main application interfaces(other than file manager interface)and modification of
view mode for objects in file manager interface.


**3.3.1** **Description and Priority**

Users are allowed to instantly access other main application interfaces(specifically
create archive interface and extraction interface-these features are described in
following chapters), as well as changing view mode for objects(archives and files)
displayed in file manager interface.
**3.3.2** **Stimulus/Response Sequences**

In the initial window of the application(file manager interface), there is a button writing
“Browser” on it. By pressing this particular button, opens a submenu with choices
that have to do with transferring to main interfaces of PeaZip and selecting view
mode for objects (archives and files) displayed in file manager interface.


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 10**_


6. Transfer and view mode selection submenu.


More specifically:
“Go to archiving layout”, leads directly to create archive interface.
“Go to extraction layout”, leads directly to extraction interface.
(Note: the previous two functions are described in detail in following chapters,
whereas the sequence of actions that was described is not the only way of
approaching those two interfaces).
“Toggle browse/flat view”, displays all together the objects contained in the current
path or in the archive.
Finally, “Refresh”, refresh/update of currently displayed content
This particular feature allows users to gain direct access to other main interfaces of
PeaZip than file manager interface. In addition, it offers an overview of the objects
that are displayed in file manager interface, which helps users to handle them better.
**3.3.3** **Functional Requirements**

Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System
Feature 1.

#### **3.4 System Feature 4**


Computer system management utilities.


**3.4.1** **Description and Priority**


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 11**_


Users can use, through PeaZip, multiple computer system (both for storage units and
the system itself) management tools.
**3.4.2** **Stimulus/Response Sequences**

In the initial window of the application(file manager interface), there is a button writing
“Tools” on it. By pressing this particular button, opens a submenu with choices that
have to do, among others, with gaining access to tool and utilities for computer
system management.


7. Computer system management tools and utilities.


More specifically:
“System tools”, collects system’s disk utilities (clean, defrag, manage, remove),
system management tools (control panel, computer management, task manager)
and displays environment variables (both for Linux and Windows).
“System benchmark” utility, rates the host system in terms of MIPS (millions of
integer instructions per second)and Core 2 Duo equivalent speed in MHz.
Through this feature, users can have quick and easy access to basic tools and
utilities of computer system management, through PeaZip application. In this way,


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 12**_


users can fine tune every possible procedure that takes place in the computer
system.
**3.4.3** **Functional Requirements**

Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System
Feature 1.

#### **3.5 System Feature 5**


File management utilities that are not strictly archiving-related.


**3.5.1** **Description and Priority**

Users can access a group of file management tools, that are not strictly archivingrelated. Users can choose from a set of utilities, like: secure file deletion, byte to byte
comparison between two files, file checking, file split/join, file information display and
hexadecimal preview of the content of a file.
**3.5.2** **Stimulus/Response Sequences**

PeaZip, offers access to a series of file management tools, from the initial window of
the application (file manager interface), as well as from create archive window(create
archive interface) and extraction window(extraction interface).
More specifically, functions that are features by the tools mentioned above are:

         - Secure file deletion, intended for securely remove files and folders from disk,
avoiding possible data recovery. This is implemented by multiple successive passes
of the deletion procedure over the storage area of the selected for deletion file.
-Byte to byte file comparison, which spots exactly what the different bytes are and is
not susceptible to collisions under any circumstance, even if conditions are highly
improbable and very difficult or not practically possible to trigger if a proper hash
function is chosen.

         - Check files, which is useful for finding duplicate files and checking files for
corruption when an original checksum or hash value is known.
-Split file and merge split volumes back to the original file.

_-_ Information display for selected (by users) files. Number of files, older and newer
object’s date/time, total space occupation, and larger and smaller object’s sizes are
presented.

         - Hexadecimal preview, which allows view of the content of a file represented as
hexadecimal values.
Through this set of features, users are allowed to handle files easier and more
adequately.
**3.5.3** **Functional Requirements**

Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System
Feature 1.

#### **3.6 System Feature 6**


Archive extraction.


**3.6.1** **Description and Priority**


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 13**_


Users can use PeaZip for decompressing the contents of a selected (by them)
compressed archive and extract them in a folder. Name and storage space of the
folder in the computer system, are up to users to decide. The archive, whose
contents are extracted, is neither destroyed, nor deleted and it is not left empty. On
the contrary, it retains its content and name and remains saved at the same place of
the computer system that was initially stored.
For the procedure of decompression and extraction to be completed, it is necessary
that the selected archive is of one of the supported for extraction by PeaZip formats.
In case the selected archive is encrypted, user must know and insert password and
(if there is one) keyfile in order to have access to the archives contents (for browsing
or extracting them).
Read-only (browsing and extraction) formats supported by PeaZip:
7z, 7z-sfx, ARC/WRC, BZ2/TBZ2, custom, GZ/TGZ, PAQ/LPAQ, PEA, QUAD/BALZ,
split, TAR, UPX, ZIP, ACE, ARJ, CAB, CHM, COMPOUND(MSI, DOC, XLS, PPT),
CPIO, ISO, Java(JAR, EAR, WAR), Linux(DEB, PET/PUP, RPM, SLP), LHA/LZH,
LZMA, Mac(DMG/HFS), NSIS, Open Office files, PAK/PK3/PK4, RAR,SMZIP, U3P,
UDF, VHD, WIM, XAR, XPI, XZ, Z/TZ
**3.6.2** **Stimulus/Response Sequences**

Decompression/Extraction function is set off and defined in extraction window (which
is also going to be referred as extraction interface). Users can get access to this
window in one of the following ways:
1) By selecting one or more archives that have suitable format for decompression
and extraction of their content from file manager interface and then pressing the
button writing “Extract” on it, from the toolbar. This is the icon of the button:


2) By pressing the button writing “Browser” on it, in file manager interface and then
selecting “Go to extraction layout” from the submenu that appears.
3) By selecting one or more archives that have suitable format for decompression
and extraction of their content from file manager interface, clicking the right button of
the mouse of the computer system(or the equivalent button of the equivalent input
device that the computer system may have)and then choosing “Extract” or “Extract(in
new folder)”.
4) By selecting one or more archives that have suitable format for decompression
and extraction of their content from some area of the computer system(outside of the
applications graphical environment), clicking the right button of the mouse of the
computer system(or the equivalent button of the equivalent input device that the
computer system may have)and then choosing “Extract”, “Extract here” or “Extract
here(in new folder)” from “Send to” menu.


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 14**_


8. Extraction window (Extraction Interface).


In Extraction window (Extraction Interface), users are given the ability of choosing the
storage space in the computer system in which the file that will contain the extracted
from the compressed archive objects will be saved, of choosing name for this file (as
well as defining what should happen in case of existence of a homonym file or
archive in the selected storage space) and of inserting password and (if needed)
keyfile, in case the archive is encrypted (locked).
This feature is one of the most important for users, because not only does it offer
access to the contents of a compressed, in one of the supported by PeaZip formats,
archive, but it allows extraction of those contents in non-compressed format too, in
order to be used according to users’ desires.
**3.6.3** **Functional Requirements**

Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System
Feature 1.

#### **3.7 System Feature 7**


Archive creation and update.


**3.7.1** **Description and Priority**


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 15**_


Users are allowed to compress one or more objects (files or archives) in one or more
compressed archive volumes (sizing less or equally to the original ones)in one of the
offered for compression by PeaZip formats. Furthermore, users are allowed to
update an archive (by adding extra objects-files or archives-to an already existing
archive), as well as choose objects that are to be included in an archive.
Name and storage space (in the computer system) for the created archives are
defined by users. In cases of updating (adding objects) the name of the compressed
file which is updated and its storage space remain the same as they were before the
update. The objects that are contained in the created archive are not destroyed, are
not deleted and are not left empty. On the contrary, they retain their content and
name and remain saved at the same space of the computer system where they were
initially stored. Furthermore, encryption (“lock”) can be used for the created archives
by setting password and (optionally) keyfile. Compression to read-only supported
formats is not possible.
Fully supported by PeaZip archiving and compression formats:
7z, 7z-sfx, ARC/WRC, BZ2/TBZ2, custom, GZ/TGZ, PAQ/LPAQ, PEA, QUAD/BALZ,
split, TAR, UPX, ZIP
**3.7.2** **Stimulus/Response Sequences**

Creating and Updating archives feature is set off and defined in Create archive
window (which is also going to be referred as Create archive Interface). Users can
approach this window in one of the following ways:
1) By pressing the button writing “File” on it in file manager interface and then
selecting “Create archive” from the submenu that appears.
2) By pressing the button writing “Browser” on it in file manager interface and then
selecting “Go to archiving layout” from the submenu that appears.
3) By selecting one or more objects to be added to an archive from file manager
interface and then pressing the button writing “Add” on it from the toolbar. This is the
icon of the button:


4) By selecting one or more objects to be added to an archive from file manager
interface, clicking the right button of the mouse of the computer system (or the
equivalent button of the equivalent input device that the computer system may have)
and then selecting “Add” from the submenu.
5) By selecting one or more objects to be added to an archive from some area of the
computer system (outside of the applications graphical environment), clicking the
right button of the mouse of the computer system (or the equivalent button of the
equivalent input device that the computer system may have) and then selecting “Add
to separate archives” from “Send to” menu.


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 16**_


9. Create archive window(Create archive Interface).


In Create archive window(Create archive Interface), users are given the ability to
select compression format (from a list of the supported by PeaZip formats for
archiving and compression) for the created archive, choose storage space (in the
computer system) where the archive is going to be saved and set archive’s name (as
well as define what should happen in case of existence of a homonym file or archive
in the selected storage space). Moreover, selected objects’ data content can be split
and be compressed into more than one archive volumes (size of each of them is
defined by user). Furthermore, timestamp can be appended to the created archive’s
name for archiving and backup purpose. Finally, encryption(“locking”)of created
archives is available, by setting password and (optionally) keyfile to them..
Archive creation and update feature is a basic PeaZip feature, as it essentially allows
users to save storage space on their computer systems by offering high compression
formats, as well as including multiple objects’ content (which can be extracted in their
initial, non-compressed format) in one single compressed archive. This makes
handling and managing multiple objects as a single unit possible. Hence, the double
advantage that this feature offers is obvious.
The additional utility of spitting compressed archives in volumes that is offered to
users in terms of this feature, allows size adjustment of the created file, while the
utility of joining them, brings contended data to their initial state, so that
decompression and extraction is possible. In this way, users are able to flexibly
manage archives and adapt application’s use to their needs, since a wide range of
choices is offered by PeaZip.
**3.7.3** **Functional Requirements**


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 17**_


Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System
Feature 1.

#### **3.8 System Feature 8**


Support of drag and drop between system and application.


**3.8.1** **Description and Priority**

Users can drag and drop objects (files or archives) between any computer system
space and the application. Application’s interfaces that support drag and drop, are
file manager interface, create archive interface and extraction interface.
**3.8.2** **Stimulus/Response Sequences**

PeaZip supports drag and drop for object transfer between computer system and the
interfaces of the application. Application’s interfaces that support this feature, are file
manager interface, create archive interface and extraction interface.
Specifically:

         - When files and folders are dragged and dropped to the file manager, they get
listed in the archive creation interface (as if they were selected and added
with “Add” button, as it was described in previous chapters), allowing fine
tuning of the function before confirming or canceling it. In the same way,
objects that are dragged and dropped to file manager interface while
browsing an archive, will be added to the current archive, if the archive format
allows modifications (e.g. adding objects to an archive format that is
supported for reading only will not be possible).

         - Dragging an archived object (file or archive) from PeaZip to the system, will
extract it to the location (of the computer system) where it is dropped. If
dragged objects are contained in a compressed archive, then they are
automatically decompressed before being extracted to the location where
they are dropped. If the dragged objects are not contained in a compressed
archive, they are just copied to the location where they are dropped.


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 18**_


10. Support of drag and drop (here from application to system).


This feature allows users to fast and directly set off basic PeaZip’s functions, making
PeaZip even handier.
**3.8.3** **Functional Requirements**

Installation of no other application is required, for PeaZip to manage this function.
The only functional requirements are:
REQ-1: Operating system on the computer system, for dragging and
dropping objects from computer system to the application.
REQ-2: MS Windows (any version) operating system on the computer
system for dragging and dropping objects from the application to the
computer system. Other operating systems (with which PeaZip is
compatible), do not support this function of this feature.

#### **3.9 System Feature 9**


Two factor authentication (password and optionally keyfile).


**3.9.1** **Description and Priority**

PeaZip allows users to encrypt (“lock”) archives during creation or updating, by using
password which is demanded by PeaZip (or other applications of the same use) and
should be inserted, in case some user wants to gain access to an encrypted
(“locked”) archive in order to manage it (e.g. browse it, update it, extract its content).
For higher security reasons, PeaZip offers users the ability to use keyfile for archives
encryption, in addition to the password. Finally, PeaZip can generate a random


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 19**_


password and create a random keyfile. Obviously, apart from encryption, PeaZip
supports decryption (“unlock”) of encrypted files.
**3.9.2** **Stimulus/Response Sequence**

In case a user wishes to “lock” an archive (during creation or update process) by
setting password and (optionally) keyfile to it, that can be achieved in one of the
following ways:
-by pressing, during the archive creation process, the icon with the lock on it and set
password and (optionally) keyfile, according to user’s preference.
-by selecting, the archive to be updated, that needs to be “locked” from file manager
interface, pressing the button writing “Tools” on it and selecting “Enter
password/keyfile” from the submenu. Password and (optionally) keyfile may then be
set in the window that appears.
-by selecting the archive to be updated,that needs to be “locked” from file manager
interface and pressing the icon with the lock on it, which appears on the status-bar
(bottom right corner). Password and (optionally) keyfile may then be set in the
window that appears.


11. Set password and keyfile.


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 20**_


12. Buttons for accessing encryption feature.


-in cases that users wish to use password and/or keyfile that the application has
created, they have to select the archive they wish to “lock” from file manager
interface, press the button writing “Tools” on it and then select “Create keyfile” on the
appearing submenu. The only thing left is setting the suggested password and
(optionally) keyfile to the (created or updated) archive in one of the ways mentioned
above.


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 21**_


13. Password and Keyfile generation utility.


This feature is really important for the security of the managed archives and their
content data. It allows users to set protection over managed archives and ensure in a
way, that no unauthorized user will have access to them.
**3.9.3** **Functional Requirements**

Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System
Feature 1.

#### **3.10 System Feature 10**


Graphic display of currently executed functions.


**3.10.1 Description and Priority**

PeaZip offers graphic display of the progress of any currently executed through/by it
function, through its graphic wrapper, named PeaLauncher. In PeaLauncher’s
window, information about the progress of any currently executed function as well as
information about its overall results (after the end of it) is displayed.
**3.10.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences**

PeaZip allows users to monitor at any time the progress and the status of any of its
functions that is being executed, as well as displaying information about the results of
those functions on the archive or file for which they were executed, information about
the contents of those archives or files and information that have to do with the
execution itself (like running time).


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 22**_


14. PeaLauncher, graphic wrapper.


Information about an object (file or archive) are displayed on PeaLauncher’s window,
in case of selection (by users) of the Test/Check feature (as described in previous
chapters) for this object.
This feature allows users to have direct and inspectional knowledge of the progress
of any ongoing functions of PeaZip at any time, as well as their results on computer
system’s objects.
**3.10.3 Functional Requirements**

Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System

#### **4.2 Hardware Interfaces**


For PeaZip’s installation and use, requirements are almost zero. It can run on any computer
system, regardless of the type of operating system used. The only thing PeaZip requires, as far as
hardware is concerned, is an x-86 compatible CPU, due to some performance critical sections
written in ASM.


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 30**_

#### **4.3 Software Interfaces**


PeaZip is compatible with:

  - All 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows
ΝΤ Χ

  - All 32-bit Microsoft Windows(95/98/ /2000/ P/Vista)

  - All POSIX(all versions of Linux/all versions of BSD/all UNIX-like operating systems)

Moreover, PeaZip is available as source code that is compatible with almost any operating system.
It is obvious, that PeaZip is independent from the operating system of the computer system on
which it runs.

To conclude, all needed software invoked by the frontend is included in PeaZip packages
(available under suitable licenses, as open source or royalty free) so no custom package is needed
to be installed to make PeaZip work (with the possible exception of some standard gtk/gdk related
libraries needed to run PeaZip, Gwrap and Pea binaries, which may be missing in some computer
systems, but are well known, trustable and widely available).

#### **4.4 Communications Interfaces**


PeaZip is not a web application, thus its installation and use does not require any
communication interfaces’ feature. However, connection to the Internet would be considered useful
for users, as, through it, they would be able to access on-line help and information about PeaZip.

### **5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements**

#### **5.1 Performance Requirements**


Do not exist.

#### **5.2 Safety Requirements**


This application should function even in cases of wrong data insertion or wrong settings. In
case of error it should provide users with appropriate help messages.

#### **5.3 Security Requirements**


Extraction (this feature is described in previous chapters)of the content of encrypted(locked)
archives through PeaZip, shouldn’t be allowed without inserting the correct password and (if
existing) keyfile for authentication. Moreover, recovering the password and the keyfile that one
PeaZip user has inserted or set to an archive(this feature is described in previous chapters)by any
other user of the computer system or the application, through the application itself or in general the
computer system. Finally, no data remains from data that have been selected to be securely
deleted should be left in the storing area of the computer system after the end of the procedure of
secure deletion (described in previous chapter), in case of selection of this feature.


_**Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip**_ _**Page 31**_

#### **5.4 Software Quality Attributes**


Any user should be able to use PeaZip without any specific knowledge or experience over
using computer systems, by reading user manuals(help documents, requirements specification
document, mini tutorials) and seeing messages and warnings that the application provides with.
