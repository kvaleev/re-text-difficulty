**Introduction**

**Purpose[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}**

This highly detailed Software Requirements Specification document
explains and describes all of the agreed upon requirements that will be
implemented for the VIRTUAL-EDU system, designed for NJIT. The document
will provide the underlining structure of VIRTUAL-EDU, in a manner that
both the Developers and the Customer will have a clear understanding of
its functions, interface, design and constraints. Once the documents are
approved by NJIT, it will also serve as a contract between the
developers and NJIT.[   ]{.Apple-converted-space}

This document is intended to be read and utilized by the development
team of VIRTUAL-EDU, including testers, programmers and project
managers, the administrators of NJIT and any stockholder interested in
seeing what NJIT is bringing forth to the university.

**Document Conventions**

The outline of this document will follow the table of contents found on
the second page of this document.

The outline is split into 6 sections.

**Section 1** - Description of the purpose of the document and what it
will contain.

**Section 2** - Overall description of the project

**Section 3** - Highly detailed description of the system functional
requirements

**Section 4** - External interface requirements that affect the system

**Section 5** - Insight on other non-functional requirements

**Section 6** - Glossary and DFD model diagrams of entire system

Each section is written with the intent that different users will read
different sections.[  ]{.Apple-converted-space}The first two sections
use universal language; while the next four sections use technical
language.

The requirements will be explained by their level of importance.[ 
]{.Apple-converted-space}Meaningful requirements will be describe first
and less meaningful requirements will be describe last.[ 
]{.Apple-converted-space}Every requirement will be mentioned and
explained with the same high level of detail.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

\

The majority of the models showcased in this document will consist of
data-flow diagram (DFD's)[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

**Project Scope**

The project being developed for NJIT goes by the name of VIRTUAL-EDU.
The requirements specified on this S.R.S. document coincide with the
university's[  ]{.Apple-converted-space}need for a new distance learning
system which will enable professors to communicate more effectively with
students via a Secure Application Platform that provides at the very
least the following features (email, group chat, bulletin board, and
audio/visual tools).[  ]{.Apple-converted-space}The proposed system will
incorporate robust features such as audio and video capabilities, in
which students within the same group or university can communicate via a
portal that provides both visual & audio functionality, file hosting and
file management, user profiles with pictures, better group collaboration
tools, and online testing capabilities.

The document will satisfy our project scope by delivering well
documented specifications, along with highly detailed models.
Furthermore, it will contain comprehensive explanations of the
functionality and constraints of each of the following requirements.

Audio and video streaming capability/ podcasting (live and on-demand)

File hosting and file management tools

User profiles with pictures including integration with other campus
resources

Chat and group collaboration tools (Instant messaging)

Online testing tools with instant grading

**Overall Description**

**Product Perspective**

Virtual-EDU consists of an online website that allows users to create a
classroom like environment with the features that it contains. Once
registered to the system, a user can create a profile sharing his or her
information with the rest of the enrolled users. Users will be able to
find commonalities with each other through the user profile. Virtual-EDU
also gives users the ability to store data and/or important materials in
a secure network location for future retrieval or present usage. This
particular data as well as other files may be shared or worked on using
Virtual-EDU extensive tools for file sharing and document collaboration.
Users can work together on a single document in real time or send their
work to other users via secure file sharing methods and protocols. If
further communication is need between users, Virtual-EDU has features
such as instant messaging, where users can hold single or group
conversations via a secure real-time communication based on typed text.
However, if more efficient means of communication are need, users have
the ability to hold single or group video/audio conferences, whereby the
users will be able to see other users streamed live in real-time.

The top level diagram below shows all of the user features that will be
implemented for the system.

\

**Product Features**

Streaming audio and video (both live and on-demand) will allow users to
interact with faculty and fellow classmates over a streaming video and
audio, one-to-one or one-to-many connection. Also, learning materials
can be delivered through audio and video formats.

The instant messaging feature will allow users to interact with faculty
and fellow classmates via text-based format, one-to-one or one-to-many
connection.

File sharing and document collaboration tools allow users to efficiently
share and develop documents and reports within a group.

User profiles containing contact information, pictures, and other
related information on a student personal page.[ 
]{.Apple-converted-space}This page will only be accessible to students
and faculty enrolled in the same class. Only the owner of the profile
may make changes to it.

Users will have the ability to manage a private temporary hosting space.
Tools such as file uploading, directory creator, move, delete and rename
will be accessible.

**User Classes and Characteristics**

**System Administrators:** User class with domain system privileges
which allows them to maintain the entire system, manage enrollment and
create virtual classes. Users in this class have complete control and
knowledge of the entire system.

**Administrative End User:** User class with domain class privileges,
which allows them to maintain and support the class they are enrolled
in, along with the other enrolled users. Users in this class have zero
knowledge of the back end of the system; however, they know the front
end of the application.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

**Limited End User:** User class with limited class privileges, which
allows them to operate the front end of the system with limited read
only permissions. Users in this class will only be able to make
modifications to their profile section.

**Operating Environment**

**System Requirements - Hardware:**

Platform: at least Microsoft Server 2003

CPU: at least Dual Core 3.6 MHz

Space:[  ]{.Apple-converted-space}Minimum of 2 gigabytes

Ram: Minimum of 4 gigabytes

**System Requirements - Software**

Web Service: Apache server

Other services: IIS 6.0 or later, .Net Framework 2.0 or later, video and
audio streaming.

**User Requirements -- Hardware:**

CPU: at least 500 MHz

Ram: at least 512 MB

Recommended Peripherals:[  ]{.Apple-converted-space}microphones, web
camera, video and audio cards.

**User Requirements -- Software**

Browser:[  ]{.Apple-converted-space}Microsoft's Internet Explorer or
Apple's Safari, or Mozilla's Firefox.

Services: SSH client, FTP client, VPN client

**Design and Implementation Constraints**

The university will be in session during the development of the
application. Since current system downtime needs to be maintained at low
levels; system rollouts and system validation need to be scheduled
during low usage periods.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

The current NJIT user database system required to run this application
may be outdated or in need of maintenance. Therefore the current system
may only house 250 concurrent users.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Not allow languages will be represented for online system documentation.

Only browsers from Microsoft, Apple and Mozilla will have functional
access to the application.

**User Documentation**

Both the enrolled students and faculty will be provided with printable
manuals through email and will have access to on-line tutorials.[ 
]{.Apple-converted-space}The system will also provide an on-line help
feature, providing the users with easy to read "how-to" instructions.
NJIT's administration will be given an in-depth manual of the entire
system, so that they may support the system after development is
complete.

**Assumptions and Dependencies**

**Current systems and databases will still be available for use and
archive.**

**Database will be modified to meet VIRTUAL-EDU's requirements. New
entities and relationships for the user will need to be added.**

**Staff is willing to accept, learn, and utilize the new system.**

**Users should have an adequate computer, network connection, and webcam
with microphone.**

**Users will have access to common programs, such as media players for
streaming.**

**System Features**

**Instant Messaging**

**Description and Priority**

Instant Messaging is the feature allowing students and professors to
interact with each other and talk in real time. Instead of leaving each
other messages on boards and going to chat rooms where screens are not
refreshed in less than 60 sec, students will be able to see who is
online and talk to them immediately. If a professor is marked online,
students will be able to ask questions and receive answers from the
professor almost instantaneously. This feature is of High Priority and
students will be able to benefit from this feature because it will give
them the feeling of a real classroom, something that most students are
complaining lacks when taking an online class.

also require an administrator to spend more time managing the FTP
accounts.[  ]{.Apple-converted-space}The first release version of this
feature was of medium priority, so adding more capabilities to it would
be of low priority as email is still a highly usable alternative.
