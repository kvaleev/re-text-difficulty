the train or the shunting movement respecting any
obstacle on the track that may violate his vehicle(s).

Dynamic train speed profile The speed-distance curve which a train may follow
without violating the static train speed profile and
the end of movement authority **.** This curve
depends on the braking characteristics of the train
and the train length.

brake applications initiated by ETCS may be
released by the driver according to a national value
except in the case of applying to train trip

and where target speed = zero.

Equipped line Trackside ETCS equipment installed to provide Full
Supervision .

Exit signal Main signal, intended for trains leaving a station.

Fixed block A block in which the extremities of the block
sections are fixed. The signalling allows a train to
move from one block to the next, normally only
when the block ahead is clear.

by the driver at any time.

In advance of B is said to be in advance of A if a train would pass
A before B in the direction of travel.

example, the ability to inform a train that the signal
ahead has cleared.

In rear of A is said to be in rear of B if a train would pass A
before B in the direction of travel.

Interlocking Trackside safety system for trains running in
stations.

Intermittent transmission Track-to-train or train-to-track transmission which
can only take place when the train passes the
information point (balise or short/medium loop or
radio area **)**

Intervention Where ETCS takes control from the driver by

                 - cutting traction power (as an option)or

                 - applying the full service brake and cutting traction
power or

                - applying the emergency brake and cutting traction
power.

capable of showing a "danger" aspect and one or
more "proceed" aspects. In some cases main
signals at "danger" are valid also for shunt
movement.

within the constraints of the infrastructure.

Moving block A block in which the extremities of the block
sections are continually adjusted according to the
position of the occupying train.

to the train.

Permissive signal A signal aspect or a signal identification, which
enables a main signal to be passed at "danger"
under special conditions, without specific
permission from signalman.

Permitted speed The speed limit at which a train is allowed to
proceed without ETCS warning and/or intervention.

Propelling A train movement, in which the driver is not
situated in the leading vehicle. When propelling
the operative cab is next to the train being
propelled and the master switch is in Forward. A
train set can not propel itself (see reversing) but is
able to propel another trainset.

Railway management system Administrative data base outside the scope of
ETCS. From this data base ETCS may provide
information for train supervision as well as for
advisory purposes.

RBC Radio Block Centre. A centralized safety unit to
establish and control train separation. Receives
location information from all trains and generates
movement authorities to all trains. May provide an
interface to interlocking systems for (partial) control
of interlocking and indications from interlocking.
Provides a train control possibility.
The ETCS data radio channel used is a safe data
transmission channel not intended for spoken
communication.


ERTMS/ETCS FRS v 5.00 94


Reference point Information point used for train location updating.
Used to correct error of odometry.

Relative braking distance A train following another in less than absolute
braking distance of the following train.

Release speed A speed value calculated by the ETCS trainborne
equipment to allow a train to approach the end of
its movement authority in a safe way. Needed for
intermittent transmission to enable the train to
approach a signal that has cleared in order to
reach the information point at the signal.

Reversing A train movement, in which the driver is not
situated in the leading vehicle. When reversing
the operative cab of a locomotive is not next to the
train being reversed. The operative cab of a train
set will be an integral part of that train set. In both
cases the master switch is in Reverse.


Route Track section prepared for train operation.

Route map A data base providing infrastructure data required
for train operation.

Safety distance Distance between the end of a movement authority
and the first possible danger point.

Shunt hauling A shunting movement, in which the driver is
situated in the leading vehicle. Hauling forward the
master switch in the operative cab is in Forward for
this operation. Hauling reverse the master switch in
the operative cab is in Reverse for this operation.

Shunt propelling A shunting movement, in which the driver is not
situated in the leading vehicle. See also propelling.

Shunting movement When vehicles are moved without train data
available.

Shunting signal A fixed signal intended for shunting movements. In
some cases Shunting signals at "danger" are valid
also for train movements.

Track free Determination of a track section not occupied by
any railway vehicle. Determination is traditionally
based on track circuits or axle counters, but may
on ETCS equipped lines be replaced by train
location and train Integrity functions.

Track occupied Track occupied by railway vehicle(s). Determination
is traditionally based on track circuits or axle
counters, but may on ETCS equipped lines be
replaced by train location and train integrity
functions. Because of the fail safe construction
track occupied could mean: track not determined
free.

Track-to-train transmission Transmission of ETCS information from any
trackside equipment to a train via balise, loop, radio
or other media. Using intermittent transmission


ERTMS/ETCS FRS v 5.00 96

signals, or similar procedures.


Train-to-track transmission Transmission of ETCS information from a train to
any trackside equipment via balise, loop, radio or
other media. Using intermittent transmission
(balise or short loop) the information can only be
transmitted from a train passing the transmission
unit.

excluding any occasion when a suppress facility is
used, and causes an immediate application of the
emergency brake.
