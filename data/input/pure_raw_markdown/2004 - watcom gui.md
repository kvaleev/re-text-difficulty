# **GUI Software Requirements Specification**

**Executive Summary**

This document describes a detailed approach to porting low-level Open Watcom GUI library to Linux
platform using GTK toolkit for the X Window System.


**1. Introduction**


**1.1 About this document**

This paper represents a result of the Open Watcom low level GUI library research. It provides porting
guidelines and identifies the effort required to port the GUI library to Linux platform using GTK
windowing toolkit for the X Window System. The research was based on the Open Watcom version 1.1.7


This paper is intended as a base Software Requirements Specification for the Open Watcom GUI porting
project.


**1.2 Document structure**

This document consists of several parts.


“GTK Overview” provides a short overview of the GIMP Toolkit


“General GUI Porting Approach” describes a porting approach.


“Issues” identifies a set of possible caveats that should be considered before commencing the porting effort.


“Target System Requirements” provides information about required software on a target system for the
ported library to run.


“Detailed Porting Guidelines and Estimation” provides detailed guidelines on porting each library
function.

**2. GTK Overview**

GTK (GIMP Toolkit) is a library for creating graphical user interfaces. It is licensed using the LGPL
license, so open software, free software, or commercial non-free software can be developed using GTK
without having to spend costs on licenses or royalties.


It's called the GIMP toolkit because it was originally written for developing the GNU Image Manipulation
Program (GIMP), but GTK has now been used in a large number of software projects, including the GNU
Network Object Model Environment (GNOME) project. GTK is built on top of GDK (GIMP Drawing Kit)
which is basically a wrapper around the low-level functions for accessing the underlying windowing
functions (Xlib in the case of the X windows system), and gdk-pixbuf, a library for client-side image
manipulation.


GTK is essentially an object oriented application ’programmers interface (API). Although written
completely in C, it is implemented using the idea of classes and callback functions (pointers to functions).


There is also a third component called GLib which contains a few replacements for some standard calls, as
well as some additional functions for handling linked lists, etc. The replacement functions are used to
increase GTK's portability, as some of the functions implemented here are not available or are non-standard
on other Unixes (one example being g_strerror)(). Some also contain enhancements to the libc versions,
such as g_malloc() that has enhanced debugging utilities.


In version 2.0, GLib has picked up the type system which forms the foundation for GTK's class hierarchy,
the signal system which is used throughout GTK, a thread API which abstracts the different native thread
APIs of the various platforms and a facility for loading modules.


As the last component, GTK uses the Pango library for internationalized text output.


Why use GTK?


It is:

        - Stable,

        - Free,

        - Fast,

        - Well documented,

        - Broadly adopted,

        - Themes support,

        - Extensible.


**3. General GUI Porting Approach**

The Watcom GUI library depends on the Watcom Programming Interface (WPI) and Memory Tracker
(TrMem) libraries. WPI is explicitly designed to port Windows functionality to OS/2 Presentation Manager
(not the other way around). Both Windows and OS/2 APIs have similar and compatible designs to a large
extent. GTK API is similar neither to Windows nor to OS/2 API, so it would be ineffective to extend the
WPI library with GTK support. However taking into account that the Watcom GUI library actively uses
WPI calls it seems reasonable to port most of the WPI functions called in the library.


Since the GUI library relies on OS/2 PM and Windows API, it uses predefined types that exist only in these
environments, such as HWND and HBRUSH. It will be an additional work for the programmer to add
appropriate type definitions in a special file. For instance, HWND should be defined as GtkWidget*, and
HBRUSH should be defined as GdkStyle*.

As long as in Windows and OS/2 environments user interface controls are placed according to the specified
coordinates we must replicate this in GTK using the following widget hierarchy:

**4. Issues**

Due to the fact that Open Watcom itself is heavy oriented towards Windows, several issues should be
considered and dealt with before commencing the porting effort.

        - Resource files


There is no possibility in GTK to handle the Windows or OS/2 – style resource files. GTK uses its own
resource files which are very much different from those in Windows or OS/2 and allows to specify only
styles and key bindings of the widgets. There is a possibility to overcome this issue to some extent by using
libglade library which is used in GTK to build user interface described in the XML file. A utility can be
written to extract all the necessary information from the Windows – OS/2 resource files and present it in
the XML format which can be handled by libglade to build a user interface. However this will provide
only a partial solution as there is nothing like String Table in libglade as string resources are
handled by gettext library in GTK. Also there are no numeric resource identifiers in GTK. Problematic
functions are: GUICreateResDialog(), GUICreateDialogFromRes() and
GUILoadString().

        - MDI "Windows in Window" model


GTK has no possibility to implement applications with MDI "Windows in Window" model. However, it is
possible to assign a parent for windows, and they will be destroyed when the parent is closed.

        - Help subsystem


GTK has no built in user help subsystem, as this level of user interaction is handled by desktop
environments. Problematic functions here are: GUIHelpInit(), GUIHelpFini(),
GUIShowHelp(), GUIDisplayHelp(), GUIDisplayHelpWin4() and
GUIDisplayHelpId().


Other issues to consider include:

        - Numeric identifiers of widgets.

        - Specific approach to window building includes Window Classes and Dialog Templates.

        - The toolkit allows modifying window (system) menu, which is impossible in GTK.

**5. Target System Requirements**

GTK is broadly adopted among the major Linux distribution vendors including RedHat, SuSE,
TurboLinux. So, in general case deployment of the ported library should not be a problem. In case the
target distribution does not support GTK at all or uses incompatible or older versions of the toolkit the
library can be linked statically, the drawback of this approach will be an increased size of the library.


In situations when the library would be shipped in source files and then compiled, target system will have
to satisfy to a number of requirements. Namely it must have a C compiler and an X Window System
including the following libraries:

        - pkg-config (only for compilation)

        - GNU make (only for compilation)

        - JPEG, PNG and TIFF image libraries

        - FreeType

        - fontconfig

        - GNU libiconv library

        - GNU gettext

        - GLib

        - Pango

        - ATK

        - GTK+

**Detailed Porting Guidelines and Estimation**


**Initial Stage**


**6. GUI Library Initialization.**

GUI library initialization procedure starts from GUIXMain() function called from predefined in the
library main().


Below is the list of subsequent function calls originated from GUIXMain().


GUIXMain()
GUIStoreArgs()
GUISetWindowClassName()
GUIGetWindowClassName()
_wpi_setwpiinst()
GUIMemOpen()
GUIFirstCrack()
SetupClass()
GUILoadStrInit()
GUIGetExtName()
GUIInitInternalStringTable()
GUIInitGUIMenuHint()
GUIGetFront()
GUIWinMessageLoop()
GUICleanup()
GUIDeath()
GUICleanupHotSpots()
GUIFreeStatus()
GUIFiniInternalStringTable()
GUILoadStrFini()
GUISysFini()
GUIFiniDialog()
GUIFree()
GUIDead()
GUIMemClose()


Majority of these functions does not need to be changed, GUISetWindowClassName() and
GUIGetWindowClassName() is not needed for GTK port at all, since GTK has no window classes.


The following functions should be ported:


GUIXMain() – 0.5 hour(s)
SetupClass() - 0.5 hour(s)
_wpi_postquitmessage() – 0.5 hour(s)
GUILoadStrInit() – 0.5 hour(s)
GUIWinMessageLoop() – 1 hour(s)


**GUIXMain**

The only function called form the main(). It initializes program GUI, processes message queue and
finishes the program.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 15 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


Time needed for porting: 0.5 hours.


**SetupClass**

Registers a window class.


There are no window classes in GTK, so this function should be empty for the GTK port.


Time needed for porting: 0.5 hours.


**_wpi_postquitmessage**

Post QUIT message into the program.


This function should be empty in GTK port since there is no need to emit QUIT message if message loop is
not started.


Time needed for porting: 0.5 hours.


**GUILoadStrInit**

Load external resource DLL under Windows, and set GUIMsgInitFlag.


Since there is no "external resource DLLs" in Linux, the GTK port should do the same that OS/2 port does,
namely, just set GUIMsgInitFlag.


Time needed for porting: 0.5 hours.


**GUIWinMessageLoop**

Starts the main program loop.


In GTK program message loop strats with gtk_main().


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**Summary**

3 hours are needed for porting and, additionally, approximately 3 more hours are needed for testing and
tuning, totaling to 6 hours for this part.


At the completion of this step we will be able to execute the following code.


int


GUImain() {}


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 16 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


**7. Display window initialization**

In order to initialize the library, programmer should call GUIWndInit() function.


Below is the list of subsequent function calls originated from GUIWndInit().


GUIWndInit()
GUISysInit()
_wpi_setdoubleclicktime()
GUISetScreen()
GUIInitDialog()
GUIStrDup()
GUIAlloc()
DialogTemplate()
DoneAddingControls()
DynamicDialogBox()
GUIInitDialogFunc()
_wpi_enddialog()


The following functions should be ported:


GUIWndInit()– 1 hour(s)
_wpi_setdouibleclicktime() – 0.5 hour(s)
GUIInitDialogFunc() – 4 hour(s)
_wpi_enddialog() – 1 hour(s)


**GUIWndInit**

High level function for the library initialization.


It is needed to use gdk_screen_get_width() and gdk_screen_get_height() applied to the
result of gdk_screen_get_default()in order to retrieve screen width and high, instead of
_wpi_get_systemmetric().


Time needed for porting: 1 hour(s).


**_wpi_setdouibleclicktime**

Sets the double click time.


Programmer should use gdk_set_double_click_time()


Time needed for porting: 0.5 hour(s).


**GUIInitDialogFunc**

Callback function the test dialog box used to get the dialog box font and client size information.


In GTK it is possible to get the dialog box font from the style returned by
gtk_widget_get_default_style().


Instead of _wpi_getclientrect(), _wpi_getwidthrect() and _wpi_getheightrect()
functions the gtk_widget_get_request_size() should be called.


Time needed for porting: 4 hour(s).


**_wpi_enddialog**

This function is used to dismiss a dialog. Note, that this does not destroy the dialog by default but only
hides the dialog.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 17 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


The similar behaviour could be achieved in GTK by emitting "delete_event" to the given window.
g_signal_emit() or g_signal_emit_by_name() should be used.


Time needed for porting: 1 hour(s).


**Summary**

6.5 hours are needed for porting activity and, additionally, approximately 3.5 hours are needed for testing
and tuning. This step requires 10 hours. At the end of this step we will be able to execute the following
code.


int


GUImain() {


GUIWndInit(250);


}


**8. Window creation**

This step requires Resource Files handling implemented (see “Issues” section).


Below is the list of subsequent function calls originated from GUICreateWindow().


GUICreateWindow()


GUISetupWnd()


GUIXSetupWnd()


GUIXCreateWindow()


GUISetupStruct()


GUICalcLocation()


GUIScaleToScreen()


GUIConvertRect()


GUIConvert()


GUIMulDiv()


GUIScaleToScreenR()


GUIConvertRect()


GUIConvert()


GUIMulDiv()


_wpi_getclientrect()


_wpi_getheightrect()


_wpi_cvtc_y_size_plus1()


_wpi_cvtc_y()


_wpi_getclientrect()


_wpi_getheightrect()


GUISetColours()


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 18 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


GUIXSetColours()

GUIInitHint()


GetStructNum()


CountMenus()


InsertHint()


GUISetGUIHint()


_wpi_create_window_ex()


GUISetRedraw()


_wpi_setredraw()


GUIMaximizeWindow()


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 19 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


GUIMinimizeWindow()


_wpi_showwindow()


GUIShowWindowNA()


GUIInvalidatePaintHandles()


GUIFreeWndPaintHandles()


GUIInitMDI()


GUIIsValidWindow()


GUIGetFront()


GUIGetNextWindow()


InList()


GUIFreeWindowMemory()


It is impossible to implement _wpi_loadmenu() and GUICreateMenus() on GTK because GTK doesn't
support OS/2-like resource files and has no possibility to modify window (system) menu.


Refer to the “Issues” section.


The following functions should be ported:


GUIXCreateWindow() – 4 hour(s)


GUICalcLocation() – 2 hour(s)


_wpi_createsolidbrush() – 2 hour(s)


_wpi_create_window_ex() – 4 hour(s)


_wpi_setredraw() – 1 hour(s)


GUIMaximizeWindow() – 1 hour(s)


GUIMinimizeWindow() – 1 hour(s)


_wpi_showwindow() – 1 hour(s)


GUIShowWindowNA() – 1 hour(s)


GUIFreeWindowMemory() – 2 hour(s)


**GUIXCreateWindow**

This high level function creates a window widget and applies the passed parameters to it.


Despite the fact that all the low-level functionality is performed by sub-calls, some tweaking may be
needed.


Time needed for porting: 4 hours.


**GUICalcLocation**

This function calculates coordinates of the new window. Note that X Window System window managers
are free to ignore this; most window managers ignore requests for initial window placement (using a userdefined placement algorithm instead) and honors requests only after the window has been shown.


Instead of using _wpi_getclientrect() to get client area coordinates of the window, programmers
should use gtk_widget_get_request_size().


Time needed for porting: 2 hours.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 20 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


**_wpi_createsolidbrush**

In Windows this returns a solid brush with color. In OS/2 PM this allocates space for the object structure
and sets the foreground colour for the brush.


For GTK this should create GtkStyle structure with the given parameters.


Time needed for porting: 2 hours.


**_wpi_create_window_ex**

This function returns pointer to newly created window widget with the given parameters.


When ported, this function should make a call of gtk_window_new(), and apply parameters passed in
info. After the window is created, it is necessary to put GtkScrolledWindow widget in it and then put
GtkFixed widget in the scrolled window widget. See “General Porting Approach” section.


Time needed for porting: 4 hours.


**_wpi_setredraw**

This function enables/disables window updates.


Should be done via gdk_window_thaw_updates() and gdk_window_freeze_updates()


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**GUIMaximizeWindow**

This function maximizes the specified window.


In order to ask the window manager to maximize the window in GTK gtk_window_maximize()
should be called.


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**GUIMinimizeWindow**

This function minimizes the specified window.


In order to ask window manager to minimize the window in GTK, gtk_window_minimize() should
be called.


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**_wpi_showwindow**

Shows the window according to the given state. Windows predefined states are used.


In the GTK gtk_widget_show() and gtk_window_hide() should be used.


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**GUIShowWindowNA**

Shows the window.


gdk_window_show() should be used


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**GUIFreeWindowMemory**

Frees all resources related to the given window.


In GTK gtk_object_destory() should be called which automatically will destroy all children. Some
additional tweaking may be needed.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 21 of 54|

|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


Time needed for porting: 2 hours.


**Summary**

19 hours are needed for porting activity and, additionally, approximately 16 more hours are needed for
testing and tuning. This step requires 35 hours. At the finish of this step we will be able to execute the
following code.


#include "gui.h"
#include "guitypes.h"

static gui_rect    Scale      = { 0, 0, 1000, 1000 };

bool MainEventWnd( gui_window *gui, gui_event gui_ev, void *param )
{
gui = gui;
gui_ev = gui_ev;
param = param;
return( TRUE );
}

**GUIXCreateDialog**

Creates a dialog with specified controls.


Instead of calling GlobalFree() here the window should be destroyed with
gtk_widget_destroy() Some tweaking may be needed.


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 28 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


**GUIDoCreateResDialog**

Creates dialog defined in resource file.


Consider Issues section.


**DialogTemplate**

Creates a dialog template.


There are no dialog templates in GTK. However, Open Watcom GUI Library adds controls to dialog
templates, so we will create a dialog in this function. gtk_window_create() is needed to create a
dialog.


Time needed for porting: 2 hours.


**AddControl**

Adds control to the specified dialog template.


There is big amount of work here. This function should create all necessary controls, and apply specified
attributes for every requested control.


Depending on type of the control and attributes various GTK functions should be used.


Time needed for porting: 8 hours.


**DoneAddingControls**

Called when there are no more controls.


Should be empty in GTK port.


Time needed for porting: 0.5 hour.


**DynamicDialogBox**

Creates a dynamic dialog box.


Should do nothing in GTK port, since DialogTemplate() function created the dialog.


Time needed for porting: 0.5 hour.


**GUIDialogFunc**

Callback function for all dynamically created dialogs.


Should be rewritten for GTK version. The callback should correctly process resizing "resizerequest" and "close" events.


Time needed for porting: 2 hours.


**GUIDestroyWnd**

Destroys the given window or all windows if NULL.


In GTK port, the function should call gtk_widget_destroy() for the given window or for the toplevel window if NULL.


Time needed for porting: 2 hours


**GUIGetText**

Returns a copy of the text.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 29 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


Should be greatly modified in GTK port, but it is a straightforward task. Text of almost all widgets could
be retrieved via gtk_label_get_label(), and gtk_button_get_label(). Note that returned
string will be owned by a widget and must not be modified or freed. So, it is needed to duplicate them in
this function.


Selection of GtkTreeView could be accessed via gtk_tree_view_get_selection() function.


Time needed for porting: 6 hours.


**GUISendMessage**

Sends a message to the specified window.


g_signal_emit() should be used for this purpose.


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**GUIWndDirty**

Tells the user interface that interface should be repainted.


gdk_window_process_updates() can repaint the window in GTK.


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**GUIGetMetrics**

Returns text metrics for font of the given window.


GUIGetDC() and GUIReleaseDC should not be called in GTK port. There is no need to work on so
low level in GTK. FontMetrics of the given window could be retrieved in the following way:


PangoContext context = gtk_widget_get_pango_context(widget);


PangoFontMetrics metrics = pango_context_get_metrics(context,


widget->style->font_desk, pango_context_get_language(context));


g_memmove(&GUItm, metrics);


pango_font_metrics_unref(metrics);


Time needed for porting: 2 hours.


**GUIGetClientRect**

Returns scaled, depending upon current scaling settings, rectangle of the given window in absolute
coordinates.


Note, that client area of the window is the area of the GtkScrolledWindow widget placed in the
window.


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**_wpi_mapwindowpoints**

Translates coordinates relative to source widget's allocation to coordinates relative to destination widget's
allocations.


The similar functionality in GTK should be achieved by
gtk_widget_translate_coordinates(). Note that there is no definition similar to
HWND_DESKTOP in GTK. To get the needed value (root window of a given widget)
gtk_widget_get_root_window() should be called for a given widget.


Time needed for porting: 2 hours.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 30 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


**_wpi_getwrectvalues**

Returns coordinates of the rectangle.


Should be rewritten using GdkRectangle type.


Time needed for porting: 0.5 hours.


**_wpi_getheightrect**

Returns height of the given rectangle.


Should be rewritten using GdkRectangle structure.


Time needed for porting: 0.5 hours.


**DrawRect**

Draws specified rectangle in the given window.


Should be rewritten. GTK paint functions applied to the GtkFixed widget placed in the window should
be used for this purpose. This approach will allow avoiding all the sub-calls.


Time needed for porting: 4 hours.


**GUIXDrawText**

Draws specified text in the given window.


Should be rewritten. pango_layout_set_text() should be used for text rendering, and
gtk_paint_layout() applied to GtkFixed widget placed in the window should be used for
drawing. This approach will allow avoiding all the sub-calls.


Time needed for porting: 6 hours.


**Summary**

41 hours are needed for porting activity and approximately 24 more hours are required for testing and
tuning. This step requires 65 hours.


**Elaboration stage**

The function should create an appropriate control with appropriate styles and other attributes in the
requested position. Already described AddControl should be used here.


Time needed for porting: 5 hours.


**GUIResizeControl**

Set size and location of a control (relative parent).


Instead of using _wpi_getdlgitem() it is needed to use GUIGetControlByID() because the last
is portable.

gtk_widget_destroy() should be called in GTK port.


Time needed for porting: 0.5 hour.


**GUIEnableControl**

Sets control enabled or not enabled.


Instead of using _wpi_movewindow() it is need to use gtk_fixed_move() to move the specified
control in the fixed widget of window where the control is located.


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**_wpi_enablewindow**

Sets specified widget enabled or disabled.


gtk_widget_set_sensitive() should be called within this function.


Time needed for porting: 0.5 hour.

Checks if control is enabled.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 32 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


Instead of using _wpi_movewindow() it is needed to use gtk_fixed_move() to move the specified
control in the fixed widget of window where the control is located.


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**_wpi_iswindowenabled**

Checks if the given widget is enabled.


gtk_widget_get_sensitive() should be called within this function.


Time needed for porting: 0.5 hour.


**GUIGetControlRect**

Gets location of a control relative to the parent.


Instead of using _wpi_movewindow() it is needed to use gtk_fixed_move() to move the specified
control in the fixed widget of window where the control is located.


Instead of using GUIGetRelRect() it is needed to use g_object_get_property() to read the
coordinates of the control, and use gtk_widget_get_size_request() to get its size.


Time needed for porting: 2 hours.


**_wpi_showwindow**

Shows or hides widget depending upon the flag.


Depending upon the flag gtk_widget_show_all() or gtk_widget_hide_all() function
should be called.


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**_wpi_iswindowwisible**

Checks if the widget is visible.


Property "visible" should be used to test if the widget is visible.


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**Summary**

13.5 hours are needed for porting activity and, additionally, approximately 13.5 hours are required for
testing and tuning. This step requires about 27 hours.

|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 33 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


Depending on the class of the given widget gtk_entry_set_text() or
gtk_label_set_label() should be used.


Time needed for porting: 4 hours.


**GUIClearText**

Clears the text.


GUISetText() should be called to perform the operation.


Time needed for porting: 0.5 hour.


**GUISelectAll**

g_memmove(&GUItm, metrics);


pango_font_metrics_unref(metrics);


Time needed for porting: 2 hours.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 35 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


**GUIGetSystemMetrics**

tuning. This step requires about 71 hour.


**13. Scrolling functions**

GUIInitHScrollCol()


GUIInitVScrollRow()


GUISetHScrollCol()


GUISetVScrollRow()


GUIGetHScrollCol()


GUIGetVScrollRow()


GUISetHScrollRangeCols()


GUISetVScrollRangeRows()


GUIGetHScrollRangeCols()


GUIGetVScrollRangeRows()


GUIDoHScroll()


GUIDoVScroll()


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 36 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


GUIDoHScrollClip()


GUIDoVScrollClip()


GUIInitHScroll()


GUIInitVScroll()


GUISetHScroll()


GUISetVScroll()


GUIGetHScroll()


GUIGetVScroll()


GUISetHScrollRange()


GUISetVScrollRange()


GUIGetHScrollRange()


GUIGetVScrollRange()


GUISetHScrollThumb()


GUISetVScrollThumb()


**Common guidelines**

WGL windows of the GTK port mush have GTKScroledWindow in them. This should contain
GTKViewPort that contains GtkFixed.


Values of the scroll bars could be set and get via gtk_scrolled_window_set_hajustment(),
gtk_scrolled_window_set_vajustment(),
gtk_scrolled_window_get_hajustment() and
gtk_scrolled_window_get_vajustment() functions.


Since the scroll bars behavior is automatic, there is no possibility to set/get scroll bar range values.
Required values could be achieved by getting width and height of the GtkFixed widget. Setting range of
a scroll means resizing of the GtkFixed widget.


Page size could be obtained from size of the GtkViewPort widget.


**Summary**

16 hours are needed for the porting activity and 16 more hours are required for for testing and tuning. This
step requires about 32 hours.


**14. Status window functions**


GUICreateStatusWindow()
GUICloseStatusWindow()
GUIHasStatus()
GUIDrawStatusText()
GUIClearStatusText()
GUIResizeStatusWindow()


**Common guidelines**

WGL windows of the GTK port mush have GTKStatus widget in them. All these functions will interact
with it.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 37 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


**GUICreateStatusWindow**

Creates a status window.


Should make the GtkStatus visible using gtk_widget_show().


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**GUICloseStatusWindow**

Closes the status window.


Should make the GtkStatus invisible using Gtk_widget_hide()


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**GUIDrawStatusText**

Draws the text to the status window.


Should use gtk_status_push().


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**GUIResizeStatusWindow**

Resizes the status window.


It is impossible to change X position of the GtkStatus in our layout; however it is never changed
through all Open Watcom sources. In addition, it isn't necessary to change vertical size of the bar because it
is done automatically. So, this function can be empty in the GTK port.


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**Summary**

4 hours are required for the porting activity and, additionally, 4 hours are required for testing and tuning.
This step requires about 8 hours.


**15. Toolbar functions**


GUICreateFloatToolBar()
GUICreateToolBar()
GUICloseToolBar()
GUIHasToolBar()
GUIChangeToolBar()
GUIToolBarFixed()


**Common guidelines**

WGL windows of the GTK port mush have GtkHandleBox widget which contains GtkToolbar
widget in itself. All these functions will interact with it.


**GUICreateFloatToolBar**

Does the same as GUICreateToolbar() which is described below.


**GUICreateToolBar**

Creates a tool bar.


Should make the GtkHandleBox visible using gtk_widget_show()


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 38 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


**GUICloseToolBar**

Closes the status window.


Should make the GtkHandleBox invisible using gtk_widget_hide()


Time needed for porting: 1 hour.


**GUIChangeToolBar**

Changes the tool bar. Makes it fixed or floating.


To make the tool bar fixed it is needed to make GtkHandleBox invisible and set parent of the
GtkToobar to parent of GtkHandleBox. To reverse the operation it is needed to make the
GtkHandleBox visible and set parent of the GtkToobar to the GtkHandleBox widget.


Time needed for porting: 2 hours.


**Summary**

4 hours are needed for porting activity and, additionally, approximately 6 more hours are needed for testing
and tuning. This step requires about 10 hours.


**16. Menu functions**

GUIAppendMenu()


GUIAppendMenuByOffset()


GUIInsertMenu()


GUIEnableMenuItem()


GUICheckMenuItem()


GUISetMenuText()


GUISetHintText()


GUIDeleteMenuItem()


GUIResetMenus()


GUIEnableMDIMenus()


GUICreateFloatingPopup()


GUITrackFloatingPopup()


GUIGetMenuPopupCount()


GUIAppendMenuToPopup()


GUIInsertMenuToPopup()


**Common guidelines**

WGL windows of the GTK port must have GtkMenuBar widget in them. All these functions will interact
with it.


**GUIAppendMenu**

Appends a menu to the menu bar.


gtk_menu_shell_append() should be used to add the menu to GtkMenuBar widget. Floating
status could be adjusted via “tear-off” state of the GtkMenu.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 39 of 54|
|---|---|
|_GUI Software Requirements Specification_||


Additionally, the menu and all items should be added in global controls table via
GUIControlInsert(), since GTK doesn't allow assigning ID to the menu items.


Time needed for porting: 2 hours.


**GUIAppendMenuByOffset**
