The term for back-to-back or set-to-set radio communications without the use of
any ground infrastructure.


Driver safety device


An on-train system which monitors the alertness of the driver and provides
warning and alarms to other systems as appropriate.


EIRENE network


An EIRENE network is a railway telecommunications network, based on the
ETSI GSM standard, which complies with all related mandatory requirements
specified in the EIRENE FRS and SRS. An EIRENE network may also include
optional features and these shall then be implemented as specified in the
EIRENE FRS and SRS. The EIRENE network excludes terminals.


EIRENE Network Access Number


A number dialled as an access code to allow use of functional numbers not
compliant with the ITU-T Rec E.164.


EIRENE system


An EIRENE system is a railway telecommunications system based on the ETSI
GSM standard, which complies with all related mandatory requirements as
specified in the EIRENE FRS and SRS. An EIRENE system may also include
optional features and these shall then be implemented as specified in the
EIRENE FRS and SRS. The EIRENE System includes terminals.


Engine number


A number assigned to an item of traction stock on a permanent basis. The engine
number may form a component of a functional number used to address
users/systems on an item of traction stock.


Fiche


A UIC fiche or leaflet is a document adopted by UIC members. Statements
within the fiche may comprise specifications which are binding on UIC members
(‘obligatory’ specifications) or optional (‘recommended’ specifications). The
existing track-to-train radio standard is contained within UIC fiche 751-3. It is
envisaged that the EIRENE standard will be covered by a new UIC fiche, 751-4.


Page 20 PSA167D006-15


_List of definitions_


Functional addressing/numbering


A term used to describe the process of addressing a call using a number
representing the function a user is performing, rather than a number identifying
the user’s terminal equipment.


Functional identity


The full alphanumeric description of the function performed by a called or
calling party within the functional numbering scheme, identifying them by
function or role rather than by a specific item of radio equipment or user
subscription. The functional identity can include characters and/or numbers.


Functional number


The full number used within the functional addressing scheme to contact an end
user/system by function or role rather than by a specific item of radio equipment
or user subscription.


General purpose radio


A standard GSM radio based closely on commercially available units for general
use.


Group call


A call made to all members of a pre-defined group within a local geographical
area. Only one member of the group may talk at any instant with all other group
members listening only.


Handover


The process by which connection between the GSM mobile and the GSM
network is maintained as the mobile moves from area to area, by passing
communication channel control from one base station to another or between
different channels in one cell.


High speed line


A section of route forming part of the European High Speed Rail Network and
any additional routes specified as such by national administrations.


Link assurance signal


A form of unidirectional signalling transmitted periodically or constantly from
one radio to another to allow the receiving user to detect a break in radio
transmission during critical manoeuvres (eg during shunting).


PSA167D006-15 Page 21


Location dependent addressing


A term used to describe the process of addressing a particular function (typically
a controller) based on the current location of the user (typically a train).


Multi-party call


A voice communication method whereby a number of parties defined by the call
initiator may participate in the call. All parties may talk simultaneously.


Multiple driver communications


A term used to describe communications between the drivers of each active cab
in a train comprising multiple traction vehicles.


Operational communications


These are railway communications directly concerned with train movements or
train operation. For example controller-driver communications.


Operational radio


A handheld radio suitable for use by people involved in railway operations (eg
shunting team members).


Power supply controller


A controller responsible for the management of the traction power supply.


Primary controller


The location and direction of movement of any particular train permits the
unique identification of a Primary Controller. The Primary Controller is
currently the co-ordinator of train emergency calls. The Primary Controller is
normally responsible for the operation of a designated area of track. The exact
responsibilities of the Primary Controller are determined on a national basis.


Radio Block Centre


An ERTMS/ETCS term referring to a centralised safety unit to establish and
control train separation using radio as the train to ground communication
medium.


Page 22 PSA167D006-15


_List of definitions_


Railway Access Code


A prefix used to identify an EIRENE network outside the network the calling
party is operating in.


Railway emergency call


A high priority call for informing drivers, controllers and other concerned
personnel of a level of danger requiring all Railway movements in a pre-defined
area to stop. Two types of Railway emergency calls are defined:

    - Train emergency calls (for Railway emergencies whilst not involved in Shunting
operations).

    - Shunting emergency calls (for Railway emergencies whilst involved in Shunting
operations).


Roaming


The use of a mobile on any communications network other than the user’s home
network.


Routing database


The database that contains the registered relationships between the functional
number and the MSISDN.


Secondary controller


A Secondary Controller is a train controller who holds responsibility for the safe
running of trains on a designated area of track (e.g. a signaller). Secondary
Controllers require the facility to communicate with trains in all situations in
order to perform their function. The split of responsibilities between Primary
Controllers and Secondary Controllers is determined on a national basis.


Shunting emergency call


A Railway emergency call used to instruct shunting teams to cease shunting
movements immediately.


Shunting team


A group of people manoeuvring trains in order to change their composition.
Communications for shunting are particularly critical when a driver at the front
of a train is pushing it backwards towards buffers or other potential obstructions.
In this case a lookout is often required to report progress to the driver.


PSA167D006-15 Page 23


Stock number


A number assigned to an item of traction or rolling stock on a permanent basis.
A stock number may form a component of a functional number used to address
users/systems on an item of traction or rolling stock.


Support communications


These are railway communications which are not directly concerned with train
movements or train operation. For example such communications might involve
the passage of catering, maintenance or timetable information.


Traffic controller


A controller who has responsibility for the scheduling of trains and the ‘flow’ of
trains over the network. For example, traffic control personnel are responsible for
such activities as holding connecting services and minimising disruption to the
timetable. The traffic control function has no formal safety responsibility.


Train control system (TCS)


The process by which the movement of a train is influenced without any action
by the driver. For the purposes of this specification, reference to the train control
system also encompasses automatic train protection, automatic train operation
and in-cab signalling.


Train controller


A controller who has responsibility for the safe movement of trains.


Train number


A number given to a train by operational staff for a particular journey. A train
number may form a component of functional number used to address
users/systems on a train.


Tromboning


Tromboning may occur when a call is placed to a roaming mobile in the same
country as the call originator. Tromboning is the term given to the routing of a
call via the mobile’s home country and back. This is obviously undesirable.


User number

The entry in a routing database. It consists of two parts: the User Identifier
Number and the Functional Code.

### **1 Introduction**

**1.1** **General**


1.1.1 This specification has been developed within UIC Project EIRENE. It specifies a digital
radio standard for the European railways. It forms part of the specification for
technical interoperability. (I)


**1.2** **Scope**


1.2.1 The EIRENE System Requirements Specification defines a radio system satisfying the
mobile communications requirements of the European railways [EIRENE FRS]. It
encompasses ground-train voice and data communications, together with the groundbased mobile communications needs of trackside workers, station and depot staff and
railway administrative and managerial personnel. (I)


1.2.2 Figure 1-1 shows how the EIRENE system is covered in this specification, by
associating each element of the system with its corresponding section number(s).
References specifying the main interfaces are also cited, and are detailed more
extensively in Appendix A. (I)

1.2.3 The application of this specification will ensure interoperability for trains and staff
crossing national or other borders between systems. It also intends to provide
manufacturing economies of scale wherever practical. (I)


**1.3** **Applicability**


1.3.1 The EIRENE System Requirements Specification defines the set of requirements which
a railway radio system shall comply with in order to ensure interoperability between
national railways. (I)


Page 26 PSA167D006-15


_1_ _Introduction_


1.3.2 The EIRENE Functional Requirements Specification [EIRENE FRS] specifies the
functional requirements for EIRENE. (I)


1.3.3 The specification distinguishes between requirements affecting a railway’s network
infrastructure, onto which mobiles will roam, and the requirements concerning
mobiles which may be used in any EIRENE compliant network. (I)


1.3.4 The statements made in the specification are assigned to one of three categories: (I)

    - Mandatory (indicated by ‘(M)’ at the end of the paragraph). It is mandatory that
each railway meets these specifications where interoperability on lines, or
equipment interoperability, is required.

    - Optional (indicated by ‘(O)’ at the end of the paragraph). Whilst not being
mandatory for interoperability, when the option is selected, the method defined in
the SRS and FRS by which such features are implemented becomes mandatory,
both to provide a consistent service and to present a recognised and agreed
standard to manufacturers in order to obtain economies of scale in development
and manufacture.

    - Information (indicated by ‘(I)’ at the end of the paragraph). These are statements
intended to provide explanatory notes.


**1.4** **System overview**


**1.4.1** **Extent of specification**


1.4.1.1 The system is based on the ETSI GSM standard. To meet additional functionality and
performance requirements, this standard is to be supplemented by: (I)

    - the following GSM services:

    - voice broadcast service;

    - voice group call service;

    - enhanced multi-level precedence and pre-emption;

    - General Packet Radio Service (GPRS);

    - railway specific applications:

    - exchange of number and location information between train and ground to support
functional and location dependent addressing;

    - emergency calls;

    - shunting mode;

    - multiple driver communications;

    - direct mode facility for set-to-set operation;

    - railway specific features, network parameters and standards:

    - link assurance signal;


PSA167D006-15 Page 27


    - calling and connected line presentation of functional identities;

    - cab radio, man-machine and other interfaces;

    - environmental specifications;

    - controller position functional specifications;

    - system configuration (numbering plans, priority levels, subscriber details, closed
user groups, etc).


1.4.1.2 The scope of the specification is shown in figure 1-2, showing the hierarchy of the
GSM, and railway features to be implemented. (I)


_Figure 1-2: Scope of the GSM-R system with reference to functionality provided by GSM_


1.4.1.3 A list of ETSI and 3GPP specifications is provided in the normative references
section of this document. (I)


1.4.1.4 Compliance to the list of normative documents is mandatory for all of the GSM
services necessary to provide the functionality specified in the [EIRENE FRS]. (M)


1.4.1.5 Later releases of these specifications may be used, providing that the system is
backwards-compatible with the versions listed. (I)


**1.4.2** **Outline architecture**


1.4.2.1 The system is based on the GSM architecture which is summarised in figure 1-3. (I)


Page 28 PSA167D006-15


_1_ _Introduction_


_Figure 1-3: GSM architecture overview_


1.4.2.2 The system comprises the following elements: (I)

    - Base station sub-systems (BSSs) of base station controllers (BSCs) controlling base
transceiver stations (BTSs) each containing a number of transceivers (TRXs).

    - Network sub-systems (NSSs) interfacing to the BSS via the GSM ‘A’ interface. The
NSS contains mobile services switching centres (MSCs) with primary responsibility
for call control. The MSC is supported by a visitor location register (VLR)
containing temporary details of subscribers active within the MSC area, a group
call register (GCR) containing attributes of voice group and broadcast call
configurations for the related MSC area and home location registers (HLRs)
holding subscriber details on a permanent basis.

    - The network also comprises General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) infrastructure
elements supporting the respective packet radio services. The serving GPRS
support node (SGSN) is a location register function storing subscription
information and location information for each subscriber registered in that node. It
interfaces to the BSS via the Gb interface and to the MSC/VLR via the Gs interface
and to the HLR via the Gr interface. The gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) is a
location register function storing subscription information and routeing
information (needed to tunnel packet data traffic destined for a GPRS MS to the
SGSN where the MS is registered) for each subscriber for which the GGSN has at
least one PDP context active. It interfaces to the SGSN via the Gn interface, to the
HLR via the Gx interface, to external packet data networks via the Gi interface and
to other GSM/GPRS networks via the Gp interface.

    - Mobile equipment (ME) interfacing to the BSS via the air (Um) interface.

    - Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs) containing information specific to single
subscribers. A standardised interface links mobile equipment to SIM cards. A SIM
and ME combined are termed a mobile station (MS).

    - Operation and Maintenance Centre (OMC) for managing the network.


PSA167D006-15 Page 29


    - Billing Centre.


1.4.2.3 Signalling within the NSS and between NSSs is carried out according to signalling
system number 7, SS7, making specific use of the mobile application part (MAP) of that
standard. (I)


1.4.2.4 Railway networks may implement a short message service centre to be interfaced to
the GSM network in order to support railway specific messaging applications. (I)


1.4.2.5 A railway GSM network is also likely to have external interfaces to: (I)

    - private railway fixed networks;

    - public operator networks;

    - controller equipment;

    - specialised railway systems (eg train control systems).


1.4.2.6 EIRENE will provide the radio bearer for ERTMS/ETCS. The EURORADIO layers are
responsible for ensuring the overall safety of the transmission link between train-borne
and trackside ERTMS/ETCS applications. (I)


1.4.2.7 In addition to a GSM capability, a direct mode capability may be provided for railway
mobiles for set-to-set operation. (I)


1.4.2.8 Standardised interface protocols are to be provided to allow applications external to
EIRENE to access EIRENE bearer services. (I)


1.4.2.9 Applications may include: (I)

    - public address;

    - intercom;

    - driver safety device;

    - train borne recorder.


**1.4.3** **Railway specific services and facilities**


1.4.3.1 To meet the specific railway requirements, a number of additional features are
required some of which have been incorporated in the GSM Standard. The main
aspects are summarised in the following paragraphs. (I)


1.4.3.2 **Frequency** : Equipment is to be capable of operation in the following frequency bands:
(I)


Page 30 PSA167D006-15


_1_ _Introduction_

|Band|Frequencies (MHz)|
|---|---|
|Railway GSM (R-GSM)|876-915/921-960|



Note: the R-GSM band includes the Public GSM (P-GSM) and Extended GSM (E-GSM)
bands.


1.4.3.3 **Voice broadcast and group call facilities** : All mobiles are to support these services as
defined in the relevant GSM specifications. The services will mainly be used to: (I)

    - broadcast messages from controllers to certain groups of trains in a controller area;

    - broadcast messages from trains or shunting team members to controllers or other
mobiles in a defined area;

    - conduct group calls between train drivers and controllers over pre-defined areas;

    - conduct group calls between trackside workers, shunting team members, station
staff and similar groups, typically over local areas.


1.4.3.4 **Enhanced multi-level precedence and pre-emption:** This GSM specification is to be
implemented in order to achieve the high performance requirements necessary for
emergency group calls. It is also necessary to meet different grades of service
requirements for different types of communications traffic on the system (eg safety (eg
train control system), operational and administrative communications). (I)


1.4.3.5 **Functional numbering:** Many railway staff need to be addressed by functional rather
than personal numbers. The functional numbers may change on a regular basis. The
principal example is that of train drivers, who need to be addressed by train numbers
which change with each journey. To overcome this difficulty a translation facility will
be provided to allow calls to functional numbers to be forwarded to the most
appropriate personal number at that time. Thus calls made to a train number are
forwarded by the network to the appropriate driver or locomotive for that train at that
time. (I)


1.4.3.6 A follow-me service will be implemented in the EIRENE network using the GSM
Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) facility to allow users to establish
and terminate the forwarding of calls from a functional number to their personal
number. (I)


1.4.3.7 **Location dependent addressing** : Train drivers need to be able to contact controllers
and other staff at the push of a single button. As the train moves through different
areas, controllers are liable to change. As a consequence it is necessary to provide a
means of addressing calls from a train to certain functions based on the location of the
train. (I)


1.4.3.8 The only source of location information available within the GSM network is the cell
that the train is in. However, there are a number of external sources from which more
accurate location information may be derived: (I)

    - on-train location systems;


PSA167D006-15 Page 31


    - trackside balises;

    - information from ground based systems.


1.4.3.9 Within EIRENE, the primary means of determining the location of a train for the
purpose of location dependent addressing will be based on the cell dependent routing.
This may be supplemented with additional information from external systems to
provide a greater degree of accuracy. (I)


1.4.3.10 **Direct mode** : Railway mobiles may support a direct communications mode whereby a
mobile can communicate with all other railway mobiles in a local area without the use
of GSM infrastructure. Such a mode is required for use where: (I)

    - no GSM infrastructure is provided;

    - GSM infrastructure equipment has failed.


**1.5** **Structure of the specification**


1.5.1 The specification is divided into the following separate sections: (I)

1. Introduction;

2. Network requirements;

3. Network configuration;

_Table 2-4: Railway specific services to be supported_


**2.6** **Alerting duration**


2.6.1 The call waiting service (CW) permits a party A to be notified of an incoming call from
party C whilst the traffic channel is not available for the incoming call and party A is
engaged in an active call with party B. However call waiting does not operate during
the prior set up of the call between the parties A and B (including alerting if used).
Therefore the alerting duration has to be as short as possible in order to minimize the
risk for the party A of missing notification of an incoming call from party C with a
higher eMLPP priority. Taking into account technical and operational aspects, it is
recommended to set the relevant timer(s) in the network in such a way that the
maximum alerting duration is limited to 60s. (I)


Page 38 PSA167D006-15


### **3 Network configuration**

**3.1** **Introduction**


3.1.1 EIRENE mobiles are specified to conform to a common minimum standard of
performance. It is the responsibility of national railways to design their EIRENE
networks to provide the required level of service to EIRENE compliant mobiles. (I)


3.1.2 This section draws together specifications and information related to the planning of
an EIRENE network and provides guidance on target performance levels. Additional
information on communication requirements for the ERTMS/ETCS application is
provided in [ERTMS COMMS]. (I)


**3.2** **Coverage**


3.2.1 For network planning, the coverage level is defined as the field strength at the antenna
on the roof of a train (nominally a height of 4m above the track). An isotropic antenna
with a gain of 0dBi is assumed. This criterion will be met with a certain probability in
the coverage area. (The target coverage power level is dependent on the statistical
fluctuations caused by the actual propagation conditions.) (I)


3.2.2 The following minimum values shall apply: (M)

    - coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level of 38.5 dBµV/m (-98 dBm)
for voice and non-safety critical data;

    - coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level of 41.5 dBµV/m (-95 dBm)
on lines with ETCS levels 2/3 for speeds lower than or equal to 220km/h.


3.2.3 The following minimum values are recommended: (I)

    - coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level of 44.5 dBµV/m (-92 dBm)
on lines with ETCS levels 2/3 for speeds above 280km/h;

    - coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level between 41.5 dBµV/m and
44.5 dBµV/m (-95 dBm and –92 dBm) on lines with ETCS levels 2/3 for speeds
above 220km/h and lower than or equal to 280km/h.


3.2.4 The EIRENE mobile installation shall be designed to operate in a network meeting the
criteria in 3.2.2 and 3.2.3. (M)


Note 1: The specified coverage probability means that with a probability value of at
least 95% in each location interval (length: 100m) the measured coverage level
shall be greater than or equal to the figures stated above. The coverage levels
specified above consider a maximum loss of 3 dB between antenna and
receiver and an additional margin of 3 dB for other factors such as ageing. (I).


Note 2: The values for ETCS levels 2/3 concerning coverage and speed-limitations are
to be validated and, if necessary, reviewed after the first operational
implementation of ETCS. (I)


PSA167D006-15 Page 39


**3.3** **Handover and cell selection**


3.3.1 The handover success rate should be at least 99.5% over train routes under design load
conditions (as given in [EN 301 515, Index [30]]). (O)


3.3.2 To avoid the necessity for large cell overlaps to accommodate high speed train
operations, optimisation of the handover process for such trains is considered
necessary. Suitable algorithms will be tested and refined as necessary during the trials
process. (I)


3.3.3 The proposed events for measurement of the start and stop of the handover execution
at the mobile are: (I)

    - receipt of ‘handover command’;

    - receipt of ‘UA’ after ‘physical info’ on new channel.


3.3.4 There is a quality of service requirement for handover executions (eg a break of 10s
would clearly be unacceptable to the user). 300ms represents our current best estimate
of the QoS figure, although this will need to be confirmed through user trials. (I)


3.3.5 An additional option is available to reduce the handover break period, namely the use
of the synchronous handover capability to reduce the break period to about 150ms.
Synchronous handover requires the BTS transmissions in different cells to be
synchronised by the system. Each authority can decide whether it wishes to use
synchronised BTSs. (I)


**3.4** **Call setup time requirement**


3.4.1 Call setup time requirement is dependent upon the eMLPP priority of a call [EN 301 515,
Index [27]]. The required priority level for each call type is given in section 10.2. (I)


3.4.2 Call setup times as defined in the EIRENE FRS shall be achieved with authentication
and ciphering procedures enabled. (M)


Note: Authentication may be delayed if necessary to achieve the required call setup
times.


3.4.3 In order to achieve these times the passage of the call through any networks external to
GSM (eg from the GSM MSC to a controller linked by an ISDN connection) must take
less than 250ms. (I)


3.4.4 Achievement of fast call setup times requires information in the setup message to be
compressed. A maximum of 12 digits may be sent as mobile originator-to-dispatcher
information. (I)


Page 40 PSA167D006-15


_3_ _Network configuration_


**3.5** **Frequency band and channel arrangements**


3.5.1 The network shall operate in a sub-band, or combination of sub-bands, of the R-GSM
band as defined in [EN 301 515, Index [35]]. (M)


3.5.2 The UIC frequency band for GSM-R is defined in [CEPT 25-09], [1999/569/EC] and

[ECC(02)05]: (I)

    - 876 – 880 MHz (mobile station transmit); paired with

    - 921 – 925 MHz (base station transmit).


3.5.3 The carrier frequency is designated by the absolute radio frequency channel number
(ARFCN), and is defined in [EN 301 515, Index [35]]. For carriers in the UIC frequency
band the following convention shall be used, where Fl(n) is the frequency value of the
carrier ARFCN n in the lower band, and Fu(n) the corresponding frequency value in
the upper band: (M)

    - Fl(n) = 890 + 0.2*(n-1024) 955 ≤ n ≤ 973

    - Fu(n) = Fl(n) + 45


Frequencies are in MHz.


**3.6** **DTMF tones and signals**


3.6.1 The minimum duration of a DTMF tone and the length of pause between tones
generated by the network (DTMF sender) and needed for the DTMF digit recognition
in the network (DTMF receiver) are specified in [3G TS 23.014, Support of Dual Tone Multi
Frequency (DTMF) signalling]. (I)


**3.7** **Termination of VGCS/VBS calls**


3.7.1 An entitled controller may terminate a VGCS/VBS call based on DTMF signalling [EN
301 515, Index [4] & [5]]. (I)


3.7.2 The network shall terminate the ongoing VGCS/VBS call if it receives the 3-digit
sequence “***” transmitted via DTMF signals. (M)


3.7.3 In order to minimise the discomfort caused by the DTMF tone added in the voice
channel, the duration of the tone generated by the fixed line dispatcher shall be 70ms ±
5ms, and there shall be a minimum gap of 65ms between each tone. (M)


**3.8** **Muting and unmuting for VGCS calls**


3.8.1 The muting and unmuting for VGCS shall be in line with [EN 301 515, Index [4]]. (M)


PSA167D006-15 Page 41


3.8.2 The network shall send the SET-PARAMETER message with the attribute “D-ATT =
T” [1] [EN 301 515, Index [6]] to the mobile station of the talking subscriber if it receives the 3digit sequence “###” transmitted via DTMF or the group call SETUP message [2] from a
controller terminal. However, receiving the 3-digit sequence “###” or the group call
SETUP message related to an additional controller while any other controller is talking
shall not result in sending another SET-PARAMETER message with the attribute “DATT = T”. (M)


3.8.3 When the network has detected the 3-digit DTMF sequence “###” transmitted via
DTMF from a controller terminal and if the controller was not previously talking it
should indicate its recognition by playing a single DTMF grant tone “#” of duration of
100ms ± 5ms to be sent to that controller terminal only. (O)


3.8.4 The network shall send the SET-PARAMETER message with the attribute “D-ATT =
F” [3] [EN 301 515, Index [6]] to the mobile of the talking subscriber only if it has received the
3-digit sequence “#**” transmitted via DTMF from all the talking controllers [4] . (M)


3.8.5 The duration of each tone (see 3.8.2 and 3.8.4) added in the voice channel, shall be 70ms
± 5ms, and there shall be a minimum gap of 65ms between each tone. (M)


1 On receiving this message, the mobile of the current talking subscriber will stop muting the down-link, thus allowing

the subscriber to hear the controller’s voice.


2 In the case of a controller as a group call originator, joiner and re-joiner speaking for the first time.


3 On receiving this message, the mobile of the current talking subscriber will resume muting the down-link, thus

preventing the subscriber from hearing their own echo.


4 This indicates that all of the controllers have indicated that they no longer wish to speak (for example, by releasing

their PTT buttons).

### **5 Cab radio**

**5.1** **Introduction**


5.1.1 This section identifies the system requirements for the EIRENE Cab radio. It defines
how the functionality is to be provided by the Cab radio system and the man-machine
interface. (I)


**5.2** **System components**


5.2.1 Figure 5-1 shows the logical architecture of an EIRENE Cab radio. The architecture
comprises the following elements: (I)

    - **GSM Mobile Termination (GSM-MT):** comprising GSM mobile equipment and
SIM;

    - **Direct Mode Mobile Termination (DM-MT):** for direct mode communications;

    - **EIRENE Cab radio applications:** standardised features outside GSM;

    - **Man Machine Interface (MMI).**


_Figure 5-1: Logical Cab radio architecture and interfaces_


5.2.2 The architecture comprises a number of interfaces between the different EIRENE-MS
elements. These are:


1) **GSM-MT air interface:** mandatory for interoperability and conformant to GSM
specifications. (M)


PSA167D006-15 Page 55


2) **DM-MT air interface:** Direct Mode is optional. However, where implemented, the
requirements concerning this interface are mandatory for interoperability. (O)


3) **GSM-MT - EIRENE Applications interface:** specified to allow the option for
separate procurement of GSM-MT and EIRENE Application equipment for the Cab
radio. The Morane FFFIS [MORANE FFFIS MTI] specifies two types of interface based
on V.24 and TDMA, both supporting [EN 301 515, Index [19]]. (O)

[Note: this interface is not required where a Cab radio is implemented as an
integrated unit.]


4) **DM-MT - EIRENE Applications interface:** specified to allow the option for
separate procurement of DM-MT and EIRENE Application equipment for Cab
radio. (O)


5) Interfaces may be provided to a Train Interface Unit and an ERTMS data interface.
More requirements are given on these interfaces, where implemented, in
subsections 5.10 and 5.15. (I)


**5.3** **Driver call-related functions**


_Call controller_


5.3.1 Upon an appropriate MMI action, the radio shall initiate a call to the appropriate
controller with ‘Railway operation’ priority (see section 10.2). (M)


5.3.2 The calling driver’s functional number shall be passed to the network using UUS1. (M)


_Call other drivers in the area_


5.3.3 On receipt of a ‘Call other drivers in area’ request, the radio shall initiate a group call
using the ‘all trains’ group identification (see section 9) with eMLPP priority level 2
(see section 10.2). (M)


5.3.4 The calling driver’s functional number shall be passed to the network using UUS1. (M)


_Send Railway emergency call_


5.3.5 Activation of the ‘Railway emergency call’ function shall cause the radio to initiate a
Railway emergency call as defined in section 13. (M)


5.3.6 The calling driver’s functional number shall be passed to the network using UUS1. (M)


_Communicate with other drivers on same train_


5.3.7 Many trains employ multiple active traction vehicles. Where these vehicles are not
connected by on-train wiring, it shall be possible for a permanent radio connection to
be established between each of the active cabs. (I)


Page 56 PSA167D006-15


_5_ _Cab radio_


5.3.8 Where there is more than one active cab, the radio connection shall be provided using
the GSM Multi-Party service. (M)


5.3.9 The call will be established from the active cab of the lead traction vehicle. Each of the
other cabs on the train will be contacted using its functional number (registered by the
other drivers prior to the establishment of the call). The procedure for setting up a
multi-party call is outlined in figure 5-2. The multi-party call shall have ‘Railway
operation’ priority (see section 10.2) and whilst on-going a ‘multi-drivers’ indication
shall be displayed permanently at all Cab radios. (M)

### **9 Numbering plan**

**9.1** **General**


9.1.1 International standardisation of the numbering plan is required to ensure interworking
between networks. Furthermore, standardised allocation of numbers to subscribers is
likely to facilitate schemes for identification, barring etc. (I)


9.1.2 This section addresses the following: (I)

    - numbering plan requirements;

    - numbering plan limitations;

    - types of numbers;

    - EIRENE numbering plan;

    - short dialling codes;

    - group addresses.


9.1.3 The precise details of the numbering plan to be chosen for particular railways will
depend upon the railway network configuration, its interconnection with other
railway networks and its interconnection with public telecommunication networks.
Equipment design must therefore be such as to give maximum flexibility in numbering
arrangements. However, it may be generally assumed that numbers (excluding access
prefixes) will not exceed 15 digits in length and will consist entirely of the digits **1** to **9**
and **0** . (I)
# 9.1.4 Characters  and #  may be used locally to gain access to special facilities such as short *****

code dialling. However, these arrangements do not form part of the network
numbering plan. (I)


9.1.5 Procedures for handling the relationship between EIRENE Numbers and MSISDN
numbers (ie registration, deregistration and re-registration) are specified in section 11.
(I)


9.1.6 Each railway should have appropriate call-barring facilities to prevent unintended
access to the GSM-R network by non-authorised users. (O)


**9.2** **Numbering plan requirements**


_Use of Train Number_


9.2.1 Within each GSM-R network, each Train Number shall be unique for the period of the
journey. (M)


9.2.2 Every On-Train Function shall be identified by a standard code and shall conform to
the list of functions given in Appendix 9A of this section. (M)


PSA167D006-15 Page 87


9.2.3 All Train Function Numbers and their associated MSISDN numbers shall be stored in
the same routing database, which is the database of the GSM-R network in which the
train is currently operating. (M)


_Use of Engine Number_


9.2.4 Every On-Engine Function shall be identified by a standard code and shall conform to
the list of functions given in Appendix 9A of this section. (M)


9.2.5 The Engine Function Number(s) and associated MSISDN numbers shall at any time be
stored as an entry in the routing database of the home GSM-R network [6] of the engine.
(M)


_Use of Coach Number_


9.2.6 The Coach Function Number(s) and associated MSISDN number(s) shall at any time
be stored as an entry in the routing database of the home GSM-R network of the coach.
(M)


_Use of Shunting Team, Maintenance Team or Train Controller Number_


9.2.7 Every Function shall be identified by a standard code and shall conform to the list of
functions given in Appendix 9A of this section. (M)


9.2.8 The functional numbers of the Shunting Team Members, Maintenance Team Members
and Train Controller (and any associated MSISDN numbers) shall be stored as entries
in the routing database of the home GSM-R network. (M)


_Use of MSISDN number_


9.2.9 Implementation of the EIRENE numbering plan shall not prohibit any authorised
caller from using the MSISDN number where known, thus enabling mobiles to be
assigned to particular personnel where this is appropriate. (M)


_Use of group call Service Areas_


9.2.10 Service areas shall be defined within each railway network. (M)


9.2.11 The numbering of Service Areas for group calls and broadcast calls shall be made in
accordance with GSM Technical Specifications [EN 301 515, Index [21] & [4]] and [EN 301 515,
Index [22] & [5]] respectively. (M)


6 The home GSM-R network is the mobile network to which the mobile on the engine is subscribed.


Page 88 PSA167D006-15


_9_ _Numbering plan_


**9.3** **Numbering plan limitations**


9.3.1 The EIRENE network can not be considered as a fully private network, as some parts
of either the mobile or fixed networks may be provided by public operators. This leads
to certain restrictions on the implementation of a numbering plan. These restrictions
are given below. (I)


_Number allocation_


9.3.2 To achieve integration of the EIRENE numbering plan with the national public
numbering plan, telephone numbers have to be allocated by the various numbering
regulatory bodies on a national basis. If functional numbers are to be used outside the
EIRENE network, they will require either a public number allocation or, alternatively,
an EIRENE Network Access Number (ENAN) may be used as described in 9.11 (I)


9.3.3 Each national railway should obtain a public numbering allocation for MSISDN
numbers from the relevant regulatory bodies. (O)


9.3.4 The EIRENE numbering plan shall be standardised to allow interoperability and shall
be implemented as a private numbering plan within the GSM-R network. (M)


_Use of alphanumerical numbers_


9.3.5 In some countries Train Numbers are alphanumeric. These numbers do not comply
with a numbering plan that can be interpreted by telephone switches and are therefore
not supported by the call routing solution given in section 11. (I)


9.3.6 If alphanumerical numbering is required within a railway network, then these
numbers may either be translated at the user terminal into a subscriber number or
conveyed between the calling party and a routing database using a nationally
determined approach. (I)


**9.4** **Types of numbers**


9.4.1 Within the GSM-R network, the user shall be able to dial the following types of
numbers: (M)

    - **National EIRENE Number (NEN)** : this number is used to route a call from the
calling party to a called party registered within the same GSM-R network;

    - **International EIRENE Number (IEN)** : this number is used to route a call from the
calling party to a called party registered within another GSM-R network;

    - **MSISDN numbers** : the number used by a subscriber of a public fixed (or mobile)
network for calling a mobile station of a GSM PLMN;

    - **Short Dialling Code (SDC)** : this number is used to allow ’speed dialling’
functionality.


PSA167D006-15 Page 89


9.4.2 In addition, Breakout Codes (BCs) shall be used to allow users within the GSM-R
network to access external numbers. (M)


9.4.3 Access from the GSM-R network to external networks shall be as detailed in section
9.10. (M)


**9.5** **Use of National EIRENE Numbers**


9.5.1 National EIRENE Numbers are used to set up calls within a single GSM-R network. (I)


9.5.2 Every railway network shall consider a number as a National EIRENE Number (NEN)
unless the number is preceded by an International Code, identifying another GSM-R
network. (M)


_Structure of National EIRENE Number_


9.5.3 The National EIRENE Number shall consist of three distinct parts, as shown in figure
9-1: (M)


_Figure 9-1: National EIRENE Number structure_

**1)** **Call Type:**

The Call Type (CT) prefix is used to distinguish between the different types of
User Numbers that are allowed within the national EIRENE numbering plan. It is
an indication to the network of how to interpret the number dialled. (I)

**2)** **User Identifier Number:**

The User Identifier Number (UIN) shall be one of the following numbers (as
identified by the CT): (M)

**- Train Number (TN)** : a number given to a train by operational staff for a
particular journey. This number shall be unique for the duration of the journey.


Page 90 PSA167D006-15


_9_ _Numbering plan_


     - **Note.** For certain Train Numbers (e.g. 1234 and 123), a risk exists when dialling
a number by keying in individual digits e.g. by the dispatcher. In this
circumstance the risk of connecting to an un-intended train exists if there is a
delay between keyed-in digits. There is no risk of ambiguity if block dialling is
employed.

     - **Engine Number (EN)** : a unique number given to a tractive unit to identify it
permanently. The UIC has introduced a uniform identification marking system
for tractive stock crossing frontiers [UIC 438-3]. In order to call a particular
locomotive, it shall be possible to call a number associated with the tractive
unit's stock number. The actual number of the unit, which shall be used as the
EN, is based on the complete identification number.

     - **Coach Number (CN)** : a unique number given to a coach (which is not a tractive
unit) to identify it permanently. The UIC has introduced a uniform
identification marking for passenger rolling stock [UIC 438-1]. In order to call a
particular coach it shall be possible to call a number associated with the vehicle
marking. The total vehicle marking consists of 12 digits. The actual number of
the coach is denoted by seven digits (positions 5 to 11 of the complete vehicle
marking), which shall be used as the CN [7] .

     - **Shunting Team Location Number (STLN)**

     - **Maintenance Team Location Number (MTLN)**

     - **Train Controller Location Number (TCLN)**

     - **Group Location Number (GLN)**

     - **Mobile Subscriber Number (MSN)**

**3)** **Function Code:**

The Function Code (FC) is used as an identification of, for example, the person or
equipment on a particular train, or a particular team within a given area.


_National EIRENE Numbering Plan_


9.5.4 The contents of the fields of a National EIRENE Number shall be as defined below: (M)


1) Call Type (CT)

This prefix defines how to interpret the User Number that follows. It shall consist
of one or two digits as defined in table 9-1.


7 In order to prevent duplication of numbering, as each railway is free to allocate the coach number
leading to number uniqueness per country only, the Owning or registering Railway code should be
added as the first digits.

### **10 Subscriber management**

**10.1** **Introduction**


10.1.1 In order to provide a consistent level of service in each railway network and, in
particular, to ensure interoperability for train drivers and other users roaming between
networks, it is important to harmonise subscription details and other information
stored in the network. (I)


10.1.2 For the purposes of defining common subscription profiles, a number of subscription
types might be used, for example: (I)

    - Cab radio;

    - on-train radio;

    - controller;

    - trackside worker;

    - general staff;

    - data systems;

    - administration/management.


**10.2** **Allocation of priorities**


10.2.1 In order to provide a consistent international service, it is necessary to ensure that
priorities are allocated consistently across all railways. The following allocation of UIC
priority levels to eMLPP priority codes is mandatory: (M)


PSA167D006-15 Page 107


|UIC Priority|Automatic<br>answering*|eMLPP priority<br>designation|Pre-emption<br>(of)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Railway emergency<br>Control-command (safety)<br> <br>Public emergency and group calls<br>between drivers in the same area<br> <br>Railway operation<br>(eg calls from or for drivers and<br>controllers) and Control-command<br>information<br>Railway information and all other<br>calls|Y <br>Y <br>Y <br> <br>Y****** <br>N|0 <br>1 <br>2 <br>3 <br>4|Control-command<br>(safety) and below<br>Public emergency,<br>group calls<br>between drivers in<br>the same area and<br>below<br>Railway operation.<br>Control-command<br>information and<br>below<br>Railway information<br>and all other calls<br>-|



       - Auto answer applies only to voice calls to mobile users as defined in [EN 301 515, Index [27]]
(eMLPP)
** Mandatory for cab radio, optional for other user equipment


_Table 10-1: Allocation of priorities_


10.2.2 Levels 0 – 4 are designed to interwork with the ISDN MLPP service. (I)


**10.3** **Access classes**


10.3.1 User access classes are defined in GSM so that under critical conditions, part of the
user population can be barred from accessing the network in order to avoid
congestion. However, such barring can be overridden by a user being a member of one
or more of the following special access classes: (I)

11 open to network operator;

12 security services;

13 public utilities;

14 emergency services;

15 network operator staff.


10.3.2 Access classes should not be used under normal network operating conditions, where
the GSM eMLPP may be used to provide a better grade of service to certain users. (O)


Page 108 PSA167D006-15


_10_ _Subscriber management_


10.3.3 For consistent working on public networks and in international roaming, the use of
access classes in a railway network shall comply with the GSM specification. (M)


10.3.4 If special access classes (eg 12 - 14) are assigned within a railway’s network to certain
high priority users, it ought to be noted that when roaming, this will only have an
effect on a national public network, subject to bilateral agreement. (I)


**10.4** **Closed user groups**


10.4.1 Closed User Groups (CUGs) may be employed by railways as an additional security
measure. Such facilities may be particularly important if public network access to the
radio system is provided (eg to prevent members of the public calling drivers and
drivers calling members of the public). (I)


10.4.2 Any implementation of CUGs must take account of requirements for interoperability.
(M)


**10.5** **Network selection**


10.5.1 SIM cards shall contain a list of authorised networks so that networks shall be
displayed (or automatically selected if automatic network selection has been enabled)
in the following order of priority (see [MORANE SIM] for more details): (M)

    - home EIRENE network;

    - ‘foreign’ EIRENE networks;

    - non-EIRENE networks (with order of priority predetermined by virtue of
international subscriptions and roaming agreements).


10.5.1i In order to shorten the duration of the network selection procedure, Mobile Stations
designed for use in EIRENE networks shall give preference to the GSM frequency
band allocated for railway use (see 3.5.2). (M)


10.5.2 The use of “Over The Air” in conjunction with the SIM Application Toolkit [EN 301 515,
Index [36]] to update SIM cards in the home network is recommended (see [MORANE SIM]
for more details). (I)


**10.6** **Cell broadcast message identifiers**


10.6.1 Railway mobiles shall be provided with cell broadcast message identifiers in order to
accept SMS-CB messages. (M)


PSA167D006-15 Page 109


**10.7** **Encryption and authentication**


10.7.1 **Encryption.** Licensing of A5/x encryption algorithms is managed by the GSM
Association. (I)


10.7.1i In case of encryption, standardised ciphering algorithms shall be used. (M)


10.7.2 Deleted.


10.7.3 Mobiles shall be capable of operation using algorithms for all countries in which they
need to roam. (M)


10.7.4 **Authentication** . Each railway is free to implement its own authentication algorithms
without any resulting loss in cross-border interoperability. (I)


Page 110 PSA167D006-15


### **11 Functional numbering and location dependent addressing**

**11.1** **Introduction**


11.1.1 There is a requirement to be able to address communications to a ‘functional number’
rather than a more permanent subscriber number. Such numbers are generally only
associated with a user for a limited period of time. (I)


11.1.2 This is an important issue which will affect interoperability and the ability to use
public network services. There are specific features of individual railways which make
it difficult to develop a concise and universally acceptable system within GSM. (I)


11.1.3 To accommodate the different requirements of the individual railways, the following
approach has been adopted: (I)

    - all responsibility for handling addressing lies with the network infrastructure and
other ground based equipment, rather than additional functionality in the mobile;

    - each railway will be responsible for implementing addressing schemes which best
meet its needs;

    - national addressing schemes are to use the internationally standardised groundtrain protocol, based on a single standardised GSM service, for exchanging
information between the ground and mobiles.


**11.2** **Ground-train addressing**


11.2.1 The ground-train addressing can be divided into two areas: (I)

    - functional addressing of mobile users;

    - location dependent addressing of fixed network users.


11.2.2 The first is related to passing information to provide an association between a mobile’s
subscriber number and its functional number. The latter is concerned with ensuring
that calls from a mobile terminal (in particular, Cab radios) are routed to the correct
destination (ie primary controller, secondary controller), based on the current location
of the mobile. (I)


11.2.3 The numbering plan to be used with functional addressing shall be in accordance with
the numbering plan given in section 9. (M)


**11.3** **Functional numbering**


_General_


11.3.1 Functional numbering provides the mechanism by which a mobile terminal, or an item
of equipment connected to a mobile terminal, can be addressed by a number
identifying the function for which it is being used. (I)


PSA167D006-15 Page 111


11.3.2 Mobile access to the functional numbering scheme for registration, deregistration and
re-registration shall apply the USSD messages and protocols over the air interface as
specified in the GSM Follow-me service. (M)


11.3.3 The implementation of functional numbering at a network level is left open for
national railways subject to the requirements for interconnecting EIRENE networks
identified in section 11.6. (I)


11.3.4 Further information may be obtained from [MORANE SSRS, MORANE FA FFFS, MORANE FA
FIS]. (I)


_Functional number management_


11.3.5 For communication over the (Um) air interface, the USSD messages and protocols as
specified in the GSM Follow-me service shall be used to manage the following types of
functional numbers: (M)

    - Train number;

    - Engine number;

    - Coach number;

    - Shunting team number;

    - Maintenance team number.


11.3.6 It shall be possible to limit user access to functional number registration and
deregistration facilities based on each of the types of functional number identified in
11.3.5. (M)


11.3.7 Mobile stations shall use the following sequences for the control of the functional
number management: (M)







|Procedure|Sequence|
|---|---|
|Interrogation|*#214*SI***#|
|Registration<br>Deregistration<br>Re-registration<br>Definition in section<br>11.3.14<br>Forced De-registration|**214*SI***#<br>##214*SI***#<br>**214*SI***# followed by ##214*SI***#<br>##214*SI*88*MSISDN*#|


Where SI Supplementary Information represents the International Functional Number
(also called the International EIRENE Number), as defined in section 9.6.3.


Note: This table is for information only. The Follow Me service control sequences are
based on the USSD specified in [EN 301 515, Index [15]].


Page 112 PSA167D006-15


_11_ _Functional numbering and location dependent addressing_


11.3.8 The network operator shall implement the required functionality to validate the
information exchanged between the mobile and network on registration and
deregistration. (M)


11.3.8i Functionality shall be provided by the system for the operator management of
Functional Numbers, including the removal of the relationship between Functional
Numbers and MSISDN Numbers. (M)


11.3.8.ii The use of the forced de-registration mechanism (without notification) to achieve this
requirement is acceptable. (I)


11.3.8iii The system shall require manual confirmation prior to the removal of the relationship
between Engine Number and MSISDN Number. (M)


_Registration_


11.3.9 The result of the registration procedure shall be sent back to the mobile. In the event of
a failure, an indication of the cause shall be provided. Information on the outcome shall
be provided to the mobile according to [EN 301 515, Index [17]] and [EN 301 515, Index [34]].
(M)


11.3.9i In the event of a registration procedure failing owing to the functional number already
being registered to another mobile, the Cab radio shall be capable of providing the user
with the ability to perform automatically the forced de-registration of the previously
registered mobile and the registration of this functional number to the user’s mobile.
This shall result in the following sequence of actions being performed by the user’s
Cab radio (see 11.3.7 for details of message structure): (M)

1. Send interrogation message (from mobile to network).

2. Receive MSISDN (from network to mobile).

3. Send a forced de-registration message (from mobile to network).

4. Receive the answer (from network to mobile).

5. Send a registration message (from mobile to network).

6. Receive the answer (from network to mobile).

7. Inform the user whether the registration of the functional number to the user’s
mobile was successful (performed by the mobile).


11.3.9ii The functionality described in 11.3.9i should also be available for other types of
mobiles. (O)


11.3.9iii In the cases described in 11.3.9i and 11.3.9ii, national rules may dictate that, prior to or
instead of performing the sequence described in 11.3.9i steps 1-7, the user shall
perform a specified action (e.g. call a dispatcher in the case of drivers). (I)


11.3.9iv The sequence described in 11.3.9i steps 1-7 may be interrupted or may require
additional user action such as a confirmation. (I)

_Deregistration_


11.3.10 Deregistration shall only be performed by the subscription identified by the MSISDN
number which is associated with the functional number. (M)


11.3.11 Deleted.


11.3.12 The result of the deregistration procedure shall be sent back to the mobile. In the event
of a failure, an indication of the cause shall be provided. Information on the outcome
shall be provided to the mobile according to [EN 301 515, Index [17]] and [EN 301 515, Index

[34]]. (M)


_Re-registration_


11.3.13 Re-registration consists of a registration procedure followed by a deregistration
procedure. (I)


11.3.14 Re-registration of on-train functional numbers based on the train number shall be
performed every time a train leaves one EIRENE network and enters into another
EIRENE network. (M)


11.3.15 Deregistration of a functional number shall not be carried out until registration of the
functional number has been carried out and confirmed as being successful. (M)


11.3.16 Each railway should define a suitable time-out interval to be applied as part of the
deregistration procedure for on-train functional numbers. (O)


_Functional numbering network interworking_


11.3.17 The exchange of information between EIRENE networks is handled by the GMSCs and
shall use the standardised protocol as detailed in section 11.6. (M)


**11.4** **Re-establishment of functional number correlation**


11.4.1 In the event of losing correlation between functional numbers and MSISDNs, provision
for recovery from such a situation shall be made. (M)


11.4.2 Each national railway is responsible for implementing a suitable recovery mechanism
and ensuring that the use of unverified functional numbers is prevented. (I)

### **13 Railway emergency calls**

**13.1** **Introduction**


13.1.1 This section covers the use of the EIRENE radio system for Railway emergency calls.
The section also discusses the facility for confirmation of such emergency calls and the
storage of confirmation for post-incident analysis. (I)


13.1.2 A Railway emergency call is a high priority call for informing drivers, controllers and
other concerned personnel of a level of danger requiring all Railway movements in a
pre-defined area to stop. Two types of Railway emergency calls are defined: (I)


      - Train emergency calls (for Railway emergencies whilst not involved in Shunting
operations);


      - Shunting emergency calls (for Railway emergencies whilst involved in Shunting
operations).


13.1.3 This section describes the handling of high priority voice calls for Railway operational
emergencies and does not cover public emergency calls (ie handling of ‘112’ calls). (I)


**13.2** **Provision of Railway emergency calls**


13.2.1 Railway emergency calls are defined as those calls of ‘Railway emergency’ priority (see
section 10) which are routed to a pre-defined user or group of users due to a railway
operational emergency. (I)


13.2.2 All Railway emergency calls shall be implemented using GSM VGCS (Specifications

[EN 301 515, Index [21] & [4]]). (M)


13.2.3 It shall be possible to configure Railway emergency group call areas to contain
combinations of cells controlled by one or more MSC(s) within one or more network(s).
(M)


13.2.4 Where Railway emergency group call areas are controlled by more than one MSC
within one or more network(s), a unique anchor MSC is defined for each group call
area. (I)


13.2.5 For international Railway emergency calls, in order to minimise call set-up times, it is
recommended that the anchor MSC always directly controls the cell where the Railway
emergency call was originated. (I)


**13.3** **Initiation of Railway emergency calls**


13.3.1 A Railway emergency call shall be initiated by using the appropriate function code for
the required type of Railway emergency call (see Table 9-8). (M)


PSA167D006-15 Page 121


13.3.2 The call area and list of train controllers for each emergency group call will be fixed in
the Group Call Register (GCR) of the anchor MSC. (I)


13.3.3 The Railway emergency group IDs required for interoperability are defined in section
9.5. The composition of each group is a matter for national implementation, although
all areas shall have a group defined for all mandated Group IDs. (M)


**13.4** **Receipt of Railway emergency calls**


13.4.1 Each mobile shall store a list of emergency Group IDs in the SIM appropriate to its
function (the Cab radio will store Group ID 299 and 599 - see table 9-8). (M)


13.4.2 All Railway emergency group IDs required for interoperability and appropriate to the
operation of the mobile shall maintain active status whilst the mobile is powered up.
(M)


13.4.3 The fixed network user will only receive emergency voice calls if designated a
dispatcher or group member in any of the calls defined in the GSM GCR. (I)


13.4.4 On receipt of a Railway emergency call, the controller’s display should indicate the
location of the train. (O)


13.4.5 If the requirement in 13.4.4 is implemented, as a minimum the location information
shall be provided by the GSM network (eg current cell or base station serving the
mobile). (M)


13.4.6 The mechanism for transferring the functional number of the originating mobile to
controllers is defined in [EN 301 515, Index [6], Release 4] using the Information Element
“Compressed OTDI” in the Immediate Setup 2 message from the originating mobile.
(I)


13.4.7 If the GSM Release 99 capability and the Immediate Setup 2 feature defined in [EN 301
515, Index [6], Release 4] are supported by the network, the network shall set the MSC
Release bit in the “Control Channel Description” information element to “1”.
Otherwise, the MSC Release bit in the “Control Channel Description” information
element shall be set to “0” (zero) [EN 301 515, Index [41]]. (M)


**13.5** **Confirmation of Railway emergency calls**


13.5.1 For post-incident analysis it is important that the initiation and receipt of Railway
emergency calls by mobiles is confirmed by a message sent to a ground-based location
(and also registered in the train borne recorder, in cases where a train borne recorder is
connected to the Cab radio). (I)


Page 122 PSA167D006-15


_13_ _Railway emergency calls_


13.5.2 Not all calls require confirmation. The application must be able to deduce that a
confirmation is necessary from the call priority, as all calls of ‘Railway emergency’
priority must be confirmed. (M)


13.5.3 Confirmation of Railway emergency calls shall be implemented using the User to User
Signalling supplementary service (UUS1). (M)


13.5.4 After clear down of the Railway Emergency call, the mobile application shall start the
confirmation process by automatically originating a call. In order to avoid network
congestion the call set up shall be delayed by a random offset. (M)


13.5.5 Railway Emergency call confirmation messages shall be of eMLPP priority 4 “Railway information and all other calls” (see section 10.2). (M)


13.5.6 The user information contained in the confirmation message shall be: (M)

      - Cab radio: the engine number or train number (if registered);

      - other mobiles: the user’s functional number (if registered).


13.5.7 Confirmation messages shall be sent to a confirmation centre using a defined short
code (see table 9-10), which shall be associated with the GSM network. (M)


13.5.8 In the case of Cab radio, details of the confirmation shall be passed to the train borne
recorder if a train borne recorder is connected to the Cab radio. (M)


13.5.9 The user-to-user information elements in the following messages, as defined in [EN 301
515, Index [16]], shall be used for the confirmation of high priority calls: (M)

    - SETUP: transfer of confirmation message to confirmation centre;

    - RELEASE COMPLETE: acknowledgement of the confirmation message.


13.5.10 The SETUP and RELEASE COMPLETE user-to-user information element shall be as
specified in the [MORANE UUIE]. (M)


13.5.10i Confirmation centres shall be capable of decoding messages in either format A or B.

### **15 Direct mode**

**15.1** **Introduction**


15.1.1 The operational requirement for direct mode is to: (I)

1) provide short range fall-back communications between train drivers and
trackside personnel in the event of failure of all railway and/or public GSM
services normally available;

2) provide short range communications for railway personnel operating in remote
areas where no GSM facilities are available.


**15.2** **System requirements**


15.2.1 Implementation of direct mode is optional. However, where implemented, the
following requirements shall be mandatory. (I)


15.2.2 Frequency modulated equipment conforming to [ETS 300 086] shall be used for direct
mode. (M)


15.2.3 Direct mode equipment shall have a maximum transmit power of 1 Watt. (M)


15.2.4 Direct mode equipment sensitivity shall be at least –107dBm. (M)


_Frequency range and mode of operation_


15.2.5 Direct mode equipment shall be capable of operation in the channels defined in table
15-1. (M)

|Channel|Frequency|
|---|---|
|1|876.0125 MHz|
|2|876.0250 MHz|
|3|876.0375 MHz|
|4|876.0500 MHz|
|5|876.0625 MHz|



_Table 15-1: Direct mode channel frequencies according to [ECC(02)05]_


15.2.6 Direct mode shall operate in simplex mode, a radio link that uses a single frequency for
alternate transmission and reception. (M)


15.2.7 Voice transmission from direct mode equipment shall be possible only when the PushTo-Talk (PTT) button is pressed. (M)


PSA167D006-15 Page 131


_CTCSS_


15.2.8 Continuous Tone Coded Squelch Systems (CTCSS) shall be implemented on all direct
mode equipment. (M)


15.2.9 The CTCSS tone shall be at a frequency of 203.5 Hz. (M)


15.2.10 The CTCSS modulation shall be within the limits defined in table 15-2. (M)







|System<br>Channel Spacing kHz|Angle<br>Peak Deviation ± Hz|
|---|---|
|12.5|200 to 400|


_Direct mode common access channel_



_Table 15-2: CTCSS modulation limits_



15.2.11 The purpose of the common access channel is to provide a point of contact and
information for all direct mode users. For example, if one direct mode user wished to
initiate contact with another user, communication would begin with a request for the
desired partner on the access channel. After receiving a reply, both parties may transfer
to a free direct mode channel and continue. (I)


15.2.12 Direct mode channel 1 (876.0125 MHz) shall serve as the common access channel. (M)


15.2.13 Equipment should default to operation on the common access channel (direct mode
channel 1) on entry into direct mode. (O)


_Direct mode interaction with GSM-R_


15.2.14 Direct mode communications will only be used in the event of normal GSM-R services
being unavailable. (I)


15.2.15 The presence of the GSM-R network shall be indicated to direct mode users. (M)


15.2.16 All terminals shall ensure that when GSM-R services are available, the user is
prevented from entering direct mode. (M)


15.2.17 In the event of GSM-R causing disruption to ongoing direct mode communications,
each railway will define a protocol for re-establishing contact by means of GSM-R. (I)


_Shunting link assurance signal_


15.2.18 All direct mode equipment shall provide the facility to broadcast an in-band audio
shunting link assurance signal as defined in subsection 14.4.2 of the [EIRENE FRS]. (M)
