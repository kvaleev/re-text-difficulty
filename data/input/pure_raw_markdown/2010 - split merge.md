### **1. Introduction**

#### **1.1 Purpose**


This document details the software requirements specification for the _PDF Split and Merge v2.1.0_
open source project. It will later be used as a base for the extension of the existing software itself.
This document follows the IEEE standard for software requirements specification documents.

PDF is the most popular file format for secure, dependable electronic information exchange. It is
used by more than half billion people and has become one of the world’s most trusted
technologies. PDF files can be viewed from almost any platform (Macintosh®, Windows®, UNIX®
and LINUX® as well as numerous mobile platforms and devices) but the manipulation of these
files is not usually free.

The purpose of this project is to provide an easy way to handle pdf files efficiently and free through
a simple graphical interface.

#### **1.2 Document Conventions**


PDF Split and Merge was created prior to this document, so all requirements stated here are
already satisfied. It is very important to update this document with every future requirement and
clarify its priority for consistency purposes, so that this document can remain useful.

Because of the fact that PDFsam is already implemented, parts of this document have a style
similar to a manual document.

Some technical information has been included. Readers can refer to Appendix A at the end of the
document for terms definition (glossary).

#### **1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions**


This Software Requirements document is intended for:

 - Developers who can review project’s capabilities and more easily understand where their
efforts should be targeted to improve or add more features to it (design and code the
application – it sets the guidelines for future development).

 - Project testers can use this document as a base for their testing strategy as some bugs are
easier to find using a requirements document. This way testing becomes more methodically
organized.

 - End users of this application who wish to read about what this project can do.

#### **1.4 Project Scope**


PDF Split and Merge is a FOSS tool that can split, merge and manipulate PDF documents. It
provides a graphical Interface (GUI) and a shell Interface (Console). It is available in two versions,
basic and enhanced, both are open source.


_**Software**_ _**Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge**_ _**Page 2**_


The GUI provides the user with all the functionality needed to handle a PDF file (or more files
together). The functionalities are distributed in plugins. Each plugin performs a specific function
and loads in the main GUI.

In the _basic_ version, the GUI contains six plugins:

 - Alternate Mix

 - Merge/Extract

 - Rotate

 - Split

 - Visual document composer

 - Visual reorder


_This is a picture of a plugin of PDFsam_


The Console is a command-line application. It’s the core application and it provides both the
enhanced and the basic features for pdf manipulation.

### **2. Overall Description**

#### **2.1 Product Perspective**


PDF Split and Merge is a multi functional tool for manipulating pdf files. It is free and open source
with a GNU General Public License (GPL). Although there are many programs for viewing pdfs,
there is not any program to handle pdfs with so many features as PDFsam. The fact that it is open
source is an extra motive for the users who have the knowledge to help with the project’s
development. In addition, there is also an enhanced version of the software that provides even
more capabilities.

#### **2.2 Product Features**


The _basic_ version provides:

 - Splitting pdf documents (into chapters, single pages, etc).

 - Merging many pdf documents or subsections of them.

 - Extract section from a pdf document in a single pdf document.

 - Mix alternate pages taken from two pdf documents in straight or reverse order into a single
document.

 - Rotate pages of the selected pdf documents.

 - Visually reorder pages of a selected pdf document.

 - Visually compose a document, dragging pages from selected pdf documents.

 - Save and load the working environment, so that recurrent jobs are automated.

 - Managing PDFsam settings and setting an environment to load at start up.


Any of those features can be executed as command prompt from the command line Console
application.


_**Software**_ _**Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge**_ _**Page 5**_

#### **2.3 User Classes and Characteristics**


This project refers to several types of users of any computer system. However, this project is
meant to be used by two major user classes:

1. General users who can use the software to cover specific needs:

 - People of all age groups without much experience because the PDFsam interface is pleasant
and user friendly and its functions are relatively simple.

 - Users with more experience on computer systems could use some advanced features offered
by PDFsam, such as executing its functions in command prompt from the command line
application. A command line console could be useful for batch jobs, server jobs (e.g. to
manipulate larger pdf files)

2. Open source software developers and contributors:

 - Software Developers: People with very good knowledge of programming language project, in
order to understand and be able to extend project’s source code.

 - Translators: People of all age groups with very good knowledge of a language not included in
the current translation list.

 - Anyone who wants to help FOSS community. The whole project is based on the conception of
Free and Open Source Software, so all people are welcome to contribute any way the
can/like.

#### **2.4 Operating Environment**


PDFsam is platform independent and it runs on every platform where a Java Virtual Machine is
available (requires a JVM version 1.6 or higher).

It has been tested on:

 - Microsoft Windows

 - GNU/Linux distributions

 - Mac OS X

Hardware requirements of the project:

 - Maximum memory usage: 254MB* (by default)

 - Disk space needed: 13.9MB

*it depends on the size of the pdf files. User can change the default value of memory with the
appropriate commands if he has to handle large pdf files.

#### **2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints**


PDFsam is platform independent and is written in Java. Its user interface is written with Java
Swing, so anyone who wishes to work on further development of PDFsam has to know this
programming language.

PDFsam is GNU GPLv2 licensed and the PDFsam-console is dual licensed (GPLv2 and LGPLv2).
Everyone, that does or is going to develop or use PDFsam, should agree and fully accept the
terms of this kind of license.


_**Software**_ _**Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge**_ _**Page 6**_

#### **2.6 User Documentation**


User documentation components are available on project’s official website:

 - [http://www.pdfsam.org/](http://www.pdfsam.org/) (in the Resources section)

Refer to section 1.5 of this document for further information.

#### **2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies**


A working Java Runtime Environment version 1.6 or above is necessary.


_**Software**_ _**Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge**_ _**Page 7**_

### **3. System Features**


PDFsam consists of a number of plugins which constitute its basic functions, and some additional
features that make the whole process easier and faster. All plugins are located in the “plugins tree”
on the left side of the GUI Interface.

This section describes the functional requirements of the application and the features it provides.
System features are described in detail to help the future extension and testing of the system.
Features stated here are already parts of the implemented system so no prioritization is needed.
Priority is needed for features to be developed that will be added to this document later.

#### **3.1 System Feature 1 - Split**


Split a pdf document through the GUI Interface. This plugin allows you to set a number of options
that will be used to split the document.

**3.1.1** **Description**

The user can divide a pdf document into parts, following
some options for how to split the document. Then he can
save the output pdf files in a directory he wants.
**3.1.2** **Stimulus/Response Sequences**

The user has to select the Split option from the plugins tree (or press the “S” key) to
display the split panel.


_This is a screenshot of the Split plugin_


_**Software**_ _**Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge**_ _**Page 8**_


The GUI Split panel consists of the following parts:

 Selection panel: The user selects the document he wants to split from a
directory. When the file is imported, some information about the file displayed
(such as pages number, pdf version…). If the document is protected the user
have to enter the password to the appropriate field and then reload the pdf.

 Split options: The user can choose between 7 types of splitting:

        - _Burst:_ the input file will be split in single pages.

        - _Split every “n” pages:_ the input file will be split every “n” pages.

        - _Split even pages:_ the input file will be split at every even page.

        - _Split odd pages:_ the input file will be split at every odd page.

        - _Split after these pages:_ the input file will be split at the given pages
numbers.

        - _Split at this size:_ the input file will be split in files of the given size (roughly).

        - _Split by bookmark level:_ the input file will be split at every page linked by the
bookmarks of the selected level (this can be very useful if you want to split
an e-book in chapters).

 Destination folder: The user selects the destination folder for the output files
(specific or same as source). Also, he can select whether he wants the output
files to be compressed or not, and the pdf version of the generated documents.

 Output options: Here the user can define a pattern that will generate filenames
for the output files. The available complex prefixes that can be used are:

        - **[CURRENTPAGE]:** This prefix variable ensures unique output filenames
and it's replaced with the current page number. The number of digits of the
generated prefix can be specified appending any number of “#” at the prefix
name, inside the square brackets (e.g. the prefix [CURRENTPAGE###] will
generate prefixes like ‘001’, ‘002’...).

        - **[TIMESTAMP]:** This prefix variable ensures unique output filenames and it's
replaced with the current date and time. Time has milliseconds precision and
the replaced variable will be something like “20100206_045107232” that is
“YYYYMMDD_HHmmssSSS”.

        - **[FILENUMBER]:** This prefix variable ensures unique output filenames and
it's replaced with a file number according to the output order. The number of
digits of the generated prefix can be specified appending any number of '#'
at the prefix name, inside the square brackets (e.g. [FILENUMBER###] will
generate prefixes like '001', '002'...). A starting number can be appended at
the prefix name inside the square brackets (e.g. [FILENUMBER13] will
generate prefixes like '13', '14'...). Finally, it can be combined a started
number and the number of digits (e.g. [FILENUMBER###13] will generate
prefixes like '013', '014'...).

        - **[BASENAME]:** This prefix variable is replaced with the original name of the
input document. It does not ensure unique output filenames and it must be
used together with other variables. If it is used alone, the system will use the
default filename pattern.

        - **[BOOKMARK_NAME]:** This prefix variable can be used only when splitting
by bookmarks level. It ensures unique output filenames (unless two or more
bookmarks have the same name) and it enables variable substitution. It's
replaced with the bookmark name. Some characters of the bookmark name
could be stripped if they are not valid character for a file name.


_**Software**_ _**Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge**_ _**Page 9**_


          - If left blank, the output filenames will take the _default pattern_

[CURRENTPAGE] _ [BASENAME].

          - It can be written anything before or after of these prefixes.

 RUN button: After the user sets all these parameters, he presses the RUN button
and the splitting starts.
**3.1.3** **Functional Requirements**


REQ-1: The user can split only once document at a time.
REQ-2: The compression of the output files requires pdf version 1.5 or above.
REQ-3: The number of digits that can be used for the unique [FILENUMBER]
prefix must be 10 or less.

#### **3.2 System Feature 2 - Merge/Extract**


Merge many pdf documents or subsections of them.

Extract sections of a document into a single document.

**3.2.1** **Description**

Users can merge many pdf documents or subsections of them together. In the same
way, they can extract some sections of a pdf document into a single document.


_This is a screenshot of the Merge/Extract plugin_


_**Software**_ _**Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge**_ _**Page 10**_


**3.2.2** **Stimulus/Response Sequences**

The user has to select the Merge/Extract option from the plugins tree (or press the
“M” key) to display the merge/extract panel.

The GUI Merge/Extract panel enables the user to select more than one file to
handle. Once the user selects the file/files they are automatically inserted into the
selection table with some specific details. Now, the user can change the order and/or
select the pages of the file/files that he wants to be included in the final document.

In the Page Selection column of the table, user can write:

       - “All”: to merge the whole document.

       - “page - to page”: to merge pages between “page” and “to page” (e.g. 8-15 if he
want to merge pages between 8 and 15).

        - “page -”: to merge pages starting from “page” till the end of the document.

       - A single page number, if he wants only that page of the document.

       - Commas (without any blanks) to separate the different values (e.g. “2,12-16,17-”
if he wants to merge page 2, pages between 12 and 16, and all the other pages
from page17 to the end).

In the Password column user has to set the password if the document is protected
and then reload the file. The user can change the order of the files by using “Move
Up” and “Move Down” buttons, or make the list be ordered by the value of a specific
column by clicking the header of that column.

The user has the ability to export the list of the selected files as an xml file that can
be used as an input file for the console “concat” command, -l option.

If the pdf documents contain forms, the user must add that to the merge options.

Finally, the user selects the output file path or let the PDFsam create one by default
to the same folder as one of the imported files. Also, he can select whether he
wants the output file to be compressed or not, and the pdf version of the generated
document. The user presses the RUN button to start the merging of the files.

**3.2.3** **Functional Requirements**


REQ-1: pages number in the page selection must be comprehended.
REQ-2: The compression of the output files requires pdf version 1.5 or above.

#### **3.3 System Feature 3 - Alternate Mix**


Mix two pdf documents.

**3.3.1** **Description**

Users may want to combine documents together by taking pages alternatively from
two existing pdf documents (e.g. for documents coming from one-sided scanners).
The resulting document will be composed by pages taken alternatively from the two
input documents.
**3.3.2** **Stimulus/Response Sequences**


The GUI Alternate Mix panel consists of the following parts:

 Selection panel: The user selects the two documents that he wants to mix from a
directory. When the files are imported, some information about the file displayed


_**Software**_ _**Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge**_ _**Page 11**_


to the selection table (such as pages number, pdf version…). If the documents
are protected the user has to enter the password to the appropriate field and
then reload the pdf. The user can change the order of the two files by using
“Move Up” and “Move Down” buttons, or make the list be ordered by the value of
a specific column by clicking the header of that column.

 Mix options: The user can modify the following parameters:

        - _Reverse first document:_ if he wants to take pages from the first document in
reverse order (starting from the last page).

        - _Reverse second document:_ if he wants to take pages from the second
document in reverse order (starting from the last page).

        - _Number of pages to switch document:_ the user with this option can define
the step size of the mix. The default behavior is to take one page from the
first document and one from the second one. However this step can be
configured by this option telling PDFsam how many pages it should take
from one document before switching to the other.

 Destination output file: The user selects the destination folder for the output files
or let the PDFsam create one by default to the same folder as one of the
imported files. Also, he can select whether he wants the output files to be
compressed or not, and the pdf version of the generated documents.

 RUN button: After the user sets the parameters, he presses the RUN button and
the mixing of the 2 documents starts.
**3.3.3** **Functional Requirements**


REQ-1: The user can mix only 2 documents at a time (not more or less).


_This is a screenshot of the Alternate Mix plugin_


_**Software**_ _**Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge**_ _**Page 12**_

#### **3.4 System Feature 4 - Rotate**


Rotates pages of pdf documents.

**3.4.1** **Description**

The users have the ability to bulk rotate pages in different documents. With this
plugin they cannot select specific pages that they want to rotate but all the
document/documents will be rotated.
**3.4.2** **Stimulus/Response Sequences**


The GUI Rotate panel consists of the following parts:

 Selection panel: The users select the documents that want to rotate their pages
from a directory. When the files are imported, some information about the file
displayed to the selection table (such as pages number, pdf version…). If the
documents are protected the users has to enter the password to the appropriate
field and then reload the pdf. The users cannot select the pages that they want to
rotate, so the whole document/documents will be rotated (for specific page rotate
refer to section 3.5).


_This is a screenshot of the Rotate plugin_


 Rotation options: The user can modify the following parameters:

        - _Clockwise rotation (in degrees):_ the users select the rotation degrees. The
rotation will be applied clockwise.

        - _Pages:_ the users select the pages they want to rotate (All, Even or Odd).


_**Software**_ _**Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge**_ _**Page 13**_


 Destination output file: The user selects the destination folder for the output files
or let the PDFsam create one by default to the same folder as one of the
imported files. Also, he can select whether he wants the output files to be
compressed or not, and the pdf version of the generated documents.

 Output options: Here the user can define a pattern that will generate filenames
for the output files. (for the available complex prefixes that can be used refer to
section 1)

 RUN button: After the user sets the parameters, he presses the RUN button and
the rotation of the 2 documents starts.
**3.4.3** **Functional Requirements**


REQ-1: The compression of the output files requires pdf version 1.5 or above.
REQ-2: The number of digits that can be used for the unique [FILENUMBER]
prefix must be 10 or less.

#### **3.5 System Feature 5 - Visually reorder**


Rotate, reorder and delete specific pages from a pdf document.

**3.5.1** **Description**

Users want an easy way to manipulate specific pages of a pdf document through a
user friendly graphical interface with simple functions. With this plugin they can
rotate, reorder or delete selected pages of a pdf file.
**3.5.2** **Stimulus/Response Sequences**


The GUI Visual reorder panel consists of the following parts:

 Selection panel: The users select the document that they want to manipulate
from a directory. The program creates thumbnails for each page of the pdf
document and presents them into a subpanel. When the thumbnails load, the
users have the following abilities:

         - Select specific pages by clicking on them through the graphical interface.

         - Change the order: The user can change pages order by:

           - Dragging them.

           - Using the “Move Up” and “Move Down” functions.

           - Reversing the selected pages: The user can select some pages and
reverse their order using the “Reverse” button.

         - Zoom-in/Zoom-out: the user can change the zoom level of the thumbnails
preview.

         - Delete/Undelete: these pages won’t be included in the output file.

          - Rotate left/right: the user can rotate the selected pages clockwise or
anticlockwise.

         - Reverse selected pages: The user can select some pages and reverse their
order.

         - Preview a selected page in a built-in Image viewer.

All these conversions can be accessed either by right clicking on the selected

#### **3.6 System Feature 6 - Visually compose**


Compose a pdf document from the pages of others pdf documents.

**3.6.1** **Description**

Users can combine multiple pdf documents in a single pdf document through a user
friendly graphical interface with simple utilities. They can open one or more pdf
documents and compose a single document that consists of parts of the original
documents. They can also make all the basic functions (reorder, rotate, reverse...) to
the final document.
**3.6.2** **Stimulus/Response Sequences**


The GUI Visual document composer panel consists of the following parts:

 Selection panel: The Selection panel is divided into two parts:

         - The panel where the user can open the input pdf documents. The user can
open several files together. They can:

           - Zoom in/out to change the scale size of the thumbnails.

           - Preview any page they want in the Image Viewer.

         - And the panel where the user composes the final document. It offers all the
basic utilities:

#### **4.2 Hardware Interfaces**


N/A

#### **4.3 Software Interfaces**


PDFsam is compatible with every system supports a JRE and pdf files. That means that is
independent from the operating system of the computer system on which it runs.

PDFsam runs on every platform where a Java Virtual Machine is available (requires a JVM version
1.6 or higher). It has been tested on various versions of Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux
distributions and Mac OS X.

#### **4.4 Communications Interfaces**


PDFsam is not a web application, so the network communication is only necessary to check for
software updates.


_The Check for updates option in the Settings panel_


_**Software**_ _**Requirements Specification for PDF Split and Merge**_ _**Page 29**_

### **5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements**

#### **5.1 Performance Requirements**


PDFsam is an application that needs a few system resources to work. This is designed not to
delay the system from other key processes. The response time of the program is direct and the
application is considered real-time.

Furthermore, the system can check for updates whenever is requested by the user, or
automatically when opening the application. In this way PDFsam will be always up-to-date with all
new supported features and bug fixes.

#### **5.2 Safety Requirements**


The application must ensure that it leaves untouched the input pdf files. No modification is allowed
to these files.

Moreover, the application should function even in cases of wrong data insertion or wrong settings.
In case of error it should provide users with appropriate help messages.

#### **5.3 Security Requirements**


PDFsam does not introduce any security level, since the data it manages is not critical. The users
in the application are all equal so there is not the need of any identity management level.

#### **5.4 Software Quality Attributes**


This application provides a pleasant and user friendly graphical interface with relatively simple
functions. Any user should be able to use PDFsam without any specific knowledge or experience
by reading the user manuals (or the help messages that are embedded in the application). Users
only need to provide some pdf documents and with just a few clicks they can perform any action.

#### **5.5 Other Requirements – GNU GPL License**


The project is released under the GNU General Public License. The philosophy of this license
implies some basic principles which apply to the project.

The GPL is a free software license, and therefore it permits people to use and even redistribute
the software without being required to pay anyone a fee for doing so.
