## **1. Introduction**

This document presents the business requirement of Unified University Inventory System
(UUIS) in Technology-independent manner. All attempts have been made in using
mostly business terminology and business language while describing the requirements in
this document. Very minimal and commonly understood Technical terminology is used.
Use case approach is used in modeling the business requirements in this document.

## **2. Purpose**

IUFA purpose is to integrate 3 faculties data bases providing Web interface that allows
user to access and manage the integrated inventory.
The IUFA guarantee a secure access to the data from outside university at any time
during working hours

## **3. Scope**

The IUFA  application give the unauthorised user the possibility to use a web based
interface that will available to use any time

IUfA involve to the following operations:


     -   Transferring assets

     -   Editing assets

    -   Modifying assets

    -   Adding inventory assets

    -   Creating request to borrow an asset or a reserve a space

     -   Retuning assets

    -   Creating a new space

    -   Approving requests

     -   Authentication

      - Search

     - Changing permission

     -   Output reports

    - Inventory administrators: users that can be delegated by any administrative
level to work and on the applications assigned permission can varies from
one user to another depending on its assigned tasks.
Inventory administrators can be affected to any administrative or
organizational level according to their assigned tasks

    - Users: students and professors

    - IT team system administrators that maintain the system

### **4.5. Permissions List**


Permission are should be grouped by role in the following way:


    - Department administrator have control on his department inventory

    - Faculty administrator have control on his faculty inventory

    - University administrator and IT Administrators have the control on the entire

inventory

    - IT administrators can create different category of permission to help

administrators to delegate a part of their tasks

This list resume all permission that a user can have

Query is killed if takes more than 1 min
Backup operation are executed periodically

### **6.5.Maintainability**

## **9. Cost Estimation (COCOMO)**

Considering a 3 months project (14w), 8 people working 10 hours/weak =>
1120 hours (/160h) = 7 person months
PM = ai*EAF*KSLOC^bi
KSLOC = (PM/(ai*EAF))^(1/bi)
KSLOC = **1.078**
Pricing per hour = $20
**Project Total = $22,400.00**
