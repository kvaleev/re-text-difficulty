# **Compiler / Linker Software Requirements** **Specification**

**Executive summary**

This document describes a detailed approach to porting Open Watcom Compiler and Linker to Linux
platform.


**1. Introduction**

This document outlines a set of steps that should be taken to provide shared libraries and position
independent code support to the Open Watcom compiler as a part of the Open Watcom Linux porting
effort.


All information is presented relative to **open_watcom_devel_1.1.7** . Since Open Watcom is open-source
project, we assume some of the topics covered might become obsolete or inaccurate at the moment of
reading this document. A considerable amount of experimental work was performed prior writing this
Specification. Some results of that work are included in this document.


This document consists of four large sections. Section one is an introductory section. Section two describes
the key components of Open Watcom C Compiler and Linker. Section three defines steps, needed for
adding PIC and shared object support. Section four describes some problems found during our
investigation.


**1.1 Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations**

|ABI|Application Binary Interface|
|---|---|
|**ELF**|**E**xecutable and**L**inking**F**ormat<br>There are three main types of ELF files:<br> A relocatable file holds code and data suitable for linking with other object files to create an<br>executable or a shared object file.<br> An executable file holds a program suitable for execution; the file specifies how the function exec()<br>creates a program’s process image.<br> A shared object file holds code and data suitable for linking in two contexts. First, the link editor may<br>process it with other relocatable and shared object files to create another object file. Second, the<br>dynamic linker combines it with an executable file and other shared objects to create a process image.<br>wlink have limited support of building and using of ELF files.|
|**OMF**|Relocatable**O**bject**M**odule**F**ormat<br>This format (developed by Microsoft) is produced by wcc386 (and has “native” support in wlink).|
|**ORL**|**O**bject**R**eading**L**ibrary<br>API for reading object files.|
|**PDC**|**P**osition**D**ependent**C**ode (opposite to PIC)|
|**PIC**|**P**osition**I**ndependent**C**ode<br>This lets a segment’s virtual address change from one process to another, without invalidating execution<br>behavior. Because PIC uses relative addressing between segments, the difference between virtual<br>addresses in memory must match the difference between virtual addresses in the file. The difference<br>between the virtual address of any segment in memory and the corresponding virtual address in the file is<br>thus a single constant value for any one executable or shared object in a given process.|

**2. Key Components of the Open Watcom C Compiler and Linker**

Certain parts of the Open Watcom source code are especially important for our project. Such parts will be
referred as “components” throughout this document, although some of them are logically interrelated
source files, and others are subprojects (subdirectories under the Open Watcom source tree). The informal
names defined here will be used in the further parts of this document.


Each component is described in two sections. First section describes the purpose of the component, and
provides the list of core source files. Second section describes the principles of function of the
corresponding component. Important functions, data structures, and constants are described as well.


**2.1 ORL**


_2.1.1 Definition_

Abbreviation of “Object Reading Library”. Located in **$OWROOT/bld/orl** .


ORL is designed for reading various formats of object files: ELF, OMF, and COFF. We are interested
mainly in the ELF stuff ( **$OWROOT/bld/orl/elf** ).


ELF linking information (e.g. relocation entries) is mapped to abstract ORL linking information. For
example, ELF relocation type **R_386_32** is mapped to **ORL_RELOC_TYPE_WORD_32** .


_2.1.2 Description_

There are several handle types defined in ORL. Most important are **orl_sec_handle** and
**orl_symbol_handle** . There are many functions operating with sections and symbols:


char *      ORLSecGetName( orl_sec_handle );


orl_sec_offset  ORLSecGetBase( orl_sec_handle );


orl_sec_size   ORLSecGetSize( orl_sec_handle );


orl_sec_type   ORLSecGetType( orl_sec_handle );


orl_sec_flags   ORLSecGetFlags( orl_sec_handle );


orl_sec_alignment ORLSecGetAlignment( orl_sec_handle );


orl_sec_handle  ORLSecGetStringTable( orl_sec_handle );


orl_sec_handle  ORLSecGetSymbolTable( orl_sec_handle );


orl_sec_handle  ORLSecGetRelocTable( orl_sec_handle );


orl_linnum *   ORLSecGetLines( orl_sec_handle );


orl_table_index  ORLSecGetNumLines( orl_sec_handle );


orl_sec_offset  ORLSecGetOffset( orl_sec_handle );


orl_return    ORLSecGetContents( orl_sec_handle, char ** );

orl_return    ORLSecQueryReloc( orl_sec_handle, orl_sec_offset,
orl_reloc_return_func );


orl_return    ORLSecScanReloc( orl_sec_handle, orl_reloc_return_func );


orl_table_index  ORLCvtSecHdlToIdx( orl_sec_handle );


orl_sec_handle  ORLCvtIdxToSecHdl( orl_file_handle, orl_table_index );


char *      ORLSecGetClassName( orl_sec_handle );


orl_sec_combine  ORLSecGetCombine( orl_sec_handle );


orl_sec_frame   ORLSecGetAbsFrame( orl_sec_handle );


orl_sec_handle  ORLSecGetAssociated( orl_sec_handle );


orl_group_handle ORLSecGetGroup( orl_sec_handle );


orl_return    ORLRelocSecScan( orl_sec_handle, orl_reloc_return_func );


orl_return    ORLSymbolSecScan( orl_sec_handle, orl_symbol_return_func );


orl_return    ORLNoteSecScan( orl_sec_handle, orl_note_callbacks *, void *
);


char *       ORLSymbolGetName( orl_symbol_handle );


orl_symbol_value  ORLSymbolGetValue( orl_symbol_handle );


orl_symbol_binding ORLSymbolGetBinding( orl_symbol_handle );


orl_symbol_type  ORLSymbolGetType( orl_symbol_handle );


unsigned char   ORLSymbolGetRawInfo( orl_symbol_handle );


orl_sec_handle   ORLSymbolGetSecHandle( orl_symbol_handle );


orl_symbol_handle ORLSymbolGetAssociated( orl_symbol_handle );


These and other functions allow access to the object file in the uniform way. Actual mapping from ELF to
ORL is performed by **$OWROOT/bld/orl/elf/c/elfentr.c** (sections, symbols), **elfload.c** (sections),
**elflwlv.c** (symbols, relocations).


ORL is used by Open Watcom Linker, mostly in **$OWROOT/bld/wl/c/objorl.c** .


ELF relocations (i.e. 386 ABI) are mapped to abstract ORL relocations in the following way:


$OWROOT/bld/orl/elf/c/elflwlv.c


static orl_reloc_type convert386Reloc( elf_reloc_type elf_type ) {


switch( elf_type ) {


case R_386_NONE:


return( ORL_RELOC_TYPE_ABSOLUTE );


case R_386_32:


case R_386_GOT32:


case R_386_GOTOFF:


return( ORL_RELOC_TYPE_WORD_32 );

case R_386_PC32:


case R_386_PLT32:


case R_386_GOTPC:


return( ORL_RELOC_TYPE_REL_32 );


default:


assert( 0 );


}


return( ORL_RELOC_TYPE_NONE );


}


**2.2 WLCore**


_2.2.1 Definition_

Synthetically selected part of the Open Watcom Linker ( **$OWROOT/bld/wl** ), performing the basic linking
tasks (e.g. relocations), and interacting to ORL. Main files: **obj2supp.c**, **objcalc.c**, **objorl.c**, **objpass1.c**,
**objpass2.c** .


_2.2.2 Description_

We are interested mainly in ELF linking. Since ORL is used to read ELF object files, there is an interface
to ORL implemented in **objorl.c** . The linker uses other data structures than ORL, so there is another
mapping implemented in the mentioned file. Relocations are mapped in the following way:


switch( reloc->type ) {


// ...


case ORL_RELOC_TYPE_ABSOLUTE:


type = FIX_OFFSET_32 | FIX_ABS;


break;


// ...


case ORL_RELOC_TYPE_REL_32:


type = FIX_OFFSET_32 | FIX_REL;


break;


// ...


case ORL_RELOC_TYPE_WORD_32:


type = FIX_OFFSET_32;


break;


}


Constants **FIX_** are defined in the spirit of OMF specification (i.e. **FIXUPP** records). However, some of
these constants implement specific features, e.g. PowerPC relocations.

// now for some handy constants which use these


FIX_BASE_OFFSET_16 = (FIX_BASE | FIX_OFFSET_16),


FIX_BASE_OFFSET_32 = (FIX_BASE | FIX_OFFSET_32),


FIX_HIGH_OFFSET_8  = (FIX_HIGH | FIX_OFFSET_8),


FIX_HIGH_OFFSET_16 = (FIX_HIGH | FIX_OFFSET_16),


} fix_type;


During the first pass, relocations are converted to internal representation:


$OWROOT/bld/wl/c/objorl.c


static orl_return P1Relocs( orl_sec_handle sec )


/**********************************************/


{


return ORLRelocSecScan( sec, DoReloc );


}


Here **ORLRelocSecScan** is ORL-function that iterates through the relocation list, and **DoReloc()** is called
to convert each relocation (see above).


Relocation processing is actually implemented in **obj2supp.c** . This file is a key part of the linker.


Other important participants of linking process are symbols. Like relocations, ELF symbols (accessible
through ORL functions) are converted to the internal **symbol** structures:


$OWROOT/bld/wl/h/syms.h


typedef struct symbol {


struct symbol *   hash;


struct symbol *   publink;


struct symbol *   link;


targ_addr      addr;


unsigned_16     namelen;


sym_info      info;    // flags & floating point fixup type.


struct mod_entry * mod;


union {


void *     edges;   // for dead code elim. when sym undefd


struct segdata *seg;    // seg symbol is in.


char *     alias;   // for aliased syms.


void *     import;   // NOVELL & OS/2 only: imported symbol
data.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 10 of 55|
|---|---|
|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


offset     cdefsize;  // altdef comdefs: size of comdef


} p;


union {


dos_sym_data  d;


struct symbol * altdefs;  // for keeping track of comdat & comdef
defs


struct symbol * datasym;  // altdef comdats: sym which has data def


int       aliaslen;  // for aliases - length of name.


} u;


union {


struct symbol * mainsym;  // altdefs: main symbol definition


struct symbol * def;    // for lazy externs


struct symbol **vfdata;   // for virtual function lazy externs.


void *     export;   // OS/2 & PE only: exported sym info.


} e;


char *       name;


char *       prefix;   // primarily for netware, though could be


// subverted for other use. gives symbol


// namespace qualification


} symbol;


There are many **SYM_** and **ST_** constants describing various symbol properties.


Finally, calculation of segment addresses (during the second pass) is performed in **objcalc.c** . Information
produced during this process will be used later for creating an executable file. One can iterate through the
groups (i.e. grouped segments) this way:


group_entry *currgrp;


for( currgrp = Groups; currgrp != NULL; currgrp = currgrp->next_group ) {


// Do something...


}


There are some important global variables. In the example above, we see **Groups** is the list of all groups.
Variable **DataGroup** specifies the data group, variable **NumGroups** contains the total number of groups.
Group entry is defined as:


$OWROOT/bld/wl/h/objstruc.h


typedef struct group_entry {


GROUP_ENTRY *    next_group;


SEG_LEADER *    leaders;


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 11 of 55|
|---|---|
|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


symbol *      sym;


section *      section;


targ_addr      grp_addr;


unsigned_16     segflags;


offset       size;


offset       totalsize;


offset       linear;     // preferred base address


union {


void *     grp_relocs;   // OS2/ELF only.


class_entry *  class;     // CV (during addr calc )


} g;


union {


unsigned    qnxflags;    // QNX


unsigned    miscflags;   // OS/2


} u;


unsigned      num;


unsigned      isfree : 1;


unsigned      isautogrp : 1;


} group_entry;


Here **size** is group size in the file; **totalsize** is group size in the memory (e.g. uninitialized data do not
require space in the file).


Another important global variable is **FmtData** . This structure contains fields describing the format and
various properties of the output file. For our purposes, the most important fields are **type** and **dll** . For ELF
shared objects, the following test evaluates as **TRUE** : **(FmtData.type & MK_ELF) && FmtData.dll** .

**2.3 Load ELF**


_2.3.1 Definition_

Part of Open Watcom Linker ( **$OWROOT/bld/wl** ), designed for writing executable files in ELF format.
Consists of two files: **loadelf.c** and **loadelf2.c** .


_2.3.2 Description_

Currently, LoadELF is able to create only ELF executable files (shared objects are not supported). Most of
the work is performed in **loadelf.c** . The second file, **loadelf2.c**, contains only the routines for creating ELF
symbol tables.


The main function is **FiniELFLoadFile()** . The following tasks are performed there:


1. Initialize the ELF header, program headers, and section headers.


2. Write groups (i.e. code and data) to the ELF file (program and section headers are changed during
this process; i.e. sections: **.text**, **.data**, and **.bss** ).


3. Write relocation section ( **.rela.text** ).


4. Write DWARF debug information (if needed).


5. Write symbol table ( **.symtab** ), hash ( **.hash** ), and strings ( **.strtab** ).


6. Write section strings ( **.shstrtab** ).


7. Write section headers.


8. Write DWARF trailer (if needed).


9. Rewind and write the ELF header and program headers.


Task 1 is performed in **void SetHeaders( ElfHdr *hdr )** . Sections are initialized in **void InitSections(**
**ElfHdr *hdr)** .


ElfHdr is defined as:


$OWROOT/bld/wl/h/loadelf2.h


typedef struct {


Elf32_Ehdr eh;


Elf32_Shdr *strhdr;


Elf32_Phdr *ph;


unsigned  ph_size;


Elf32_Shdr *sh;


unsigned  sh_size;


stringtable secstrtab;


struct {


int    secstr; // Index of strings section for section names


int    grpbase; // Index base for Groups in section


int    grpnum; // Number of groups


int    relbase; // Index base for relocation sections


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 13 of 55|
|---|---|
|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


int    relnum; // number of relocations


int    symstr; // Index of symbol's string table


int    symtab; // Index of symbol table


int    symhash; // Index of symbol hash table


int    dbgbegin;// Index of first debug section


int    dbgnum; // Number of debug sections


} i; // Indexes into sh


unsigned_32 curr_off;


} ElfHdr;


The most interesting structure is **i**, where section indexes are specified. This structure is filled in
**InitSections()** . So the order of sections is predefined.


Program header is created in **SetHeaders()** as well.


Task 2 is performed in **void WriteELFGroups( ElfHdr *hdr )** . In this function, group list is iterated (as
described in WLCore). For each group, code or data are written to the ELF file, using **WriteGroupLoad()** .
The corresponding program headers and sections are filled as well, using **SetGroupHeaders()** . Note that
uninitialized data ( **.bss** ) are processed in the special way.


Relocations are written using **void WriteRelocsSections( ElfHdr *hdr )** . In this implementation, all
relocations are presented with explicit addends (i.e. **SHT_RELA** ).


Task 5 is performed by **WriteElfSymTable( ElfSymTable *tab, ElfHdr *hdr, int hashidx, int**
**symtabidx, int strtabidx )** . Both symbol table and hash are written in this function. Then string table is
written using **WriteSHStrings()** .


Function **WriteSHStrings()** is reused for the next task (i.e. writing section names).


Note that field **curr_off** (from **ElfHdr** ) is widely used. This field specifies the current offset in the ELF
file. However, it is not updated automatically, e.g. after **WriteLoad()** therefore precise calculations are
needed to keep this value up to date.


Functions to write ELF (and other) executable files are located in **$OWROOT/bld/wl/c/loadfile.c** .


**2.4 GC386**


_2.4.1 Definition_

Code Generator for 32-bit family of x86 CPUs, used by Open Watcom C Compiler consists of three
“layers”:

        - General Code Generator, located in **$OWROOT/bld/cg** .

        - Common x86 Code Generator (16/32-bit), located in **$OWROOT/bld/cg/intel** .

        - Specific 32-bit x86 Code Generator, located in **$OWROOT/bld/cg/intel/386** .


_2.4.2 Description_

Documentation for the Code Generator ( **$OWROOT/bld/cg/doc** ) covers only the interface to the code
generator (i.e. "General Code Generator"). The code generator (back end) interface is a set of procedure
calls. These are divided into Code Generation ( **CG** ), Data Generation ( **DG** ), miscellaneous Back End ( **BE** ),
Front end supplied ( **FE** ), and debugger information ( **DB** ) routines.

There is internal machine-independent format (allowing scalability, multiple platforms, and machineindependent optimizations). The main parts of these intermediate data (passed to the code generator for
particular machine) are "blocks" and "instructions":


$OWROOT/bld/cg/h/block.h


typedef struct block {


struct block_ins    ins;


struct block      *next_block;  /* used for DFS */

**Sample:** Walking through the blocks and instructions


block    *blk;


instruction *ins;


blk = HeadBlock;


while( blk != NULL ) {


ins = blk->ins.hd.next;


while( ins->head.opcode != OP_BLOCK ) {


// Do something...


ins = ins->head.next;


}


blk = blk->next_block;


}


Instructions are machine-independent. For example, **opcode == OP_ADD** specifies addition. Operands and
result have the **name** type that can represent CPU register, memory location, immediate constant, etc.:


$OWROOT/bld/cg/h/name.h


typedef union name {


struct name_def    n;


struct var_name    v;


struct const_name   c;


struct memory_name   m;

struct temp_name    t;


struct register_name  r;


struct indexed_name  i;


union  name      *_n;


} name;


This data looks like machine-dependent, since different architectures have different registers. However, this
is top-level abstraction. The code generator for particular architecture supplies the corresponding set of
registers. Actually there are many register sets (e.g. stack pointer, registers for temporary storage, fixed
registers, etc.) The **hw_reg_set** type is able to hold one or more registers (or be empty).


For 32-bit family of x86 processors, the register sets are defined in **$OWROOT/cg/intel/386/c/386rgtbl.c** .


There are many inline functions operating with register sets ( **$OWROOT/cg/h/cghwreg.h** ). Most of them
implement "set arithmetic": **HW_Asgn**, **HW_CAsgn**, **HW_CEqual**, **HW_COnlyOn**, **HW_COvlap**,
**HW_CSubset**, **HW_CTurnOff**, **HW_CTurnOn**, **HW_Equal**, **HW_OnlyOn**, **HW_Ovlap**, **HW_Subset**,
**HW_TurnOff**, **HW_TurnOn** .


**Sample:** Excluding the **EBX** register (required for PIC)


hw_reg_set all;


// ...


HW_CTurnOff( all, HW_EBX );


There are two levels of code generation for x86: middle level and low level (assuming high level is
machine-independent).


High level uses **instruction** and related functions (only some are shown):


// Creating new instruction


instruction *MakeUnary( opcode_defs, name *, name *, type_class_def );


instruction *MakeBinary( opcode_defs, name *, name *, name *, type_class_def );


instruction *MakeMove( name *, name *, type_class_def );


// Miscellaneous allocations


name *AllocRegName( hw_reg_set );


name *AllocTemp( type_class_def );


name *AllocIntConst( int );


name *AllocUIntConst( uint );


// Placing the instruction


void AddIns( instruction * );


void PrefixIns( instruction *, instruction * );


void SuffixIns( instruction *, instruction * );


void ReplIns( instruction *, instruction * );

**Sample:** Generating add ebx, 0BABEh in the current block


name    *ebx;


instruction *ins;


ebx = AllocRegName( HW_EBX );


ins = MakeBinary( OP_ADD, ebx, AllocIntConst( 0xBABE ), ebx, WD );


AddIns(ins);


At the low level, we generate the actual x86 opcodes (once and for all). Transformation from middle level
to low level is performed mainly by **i86enc.c**, **i86enc2.c** ( **$OWROOT/bld/cg/intel** ), **i86enc32.c**
( **$OWROOT/bld/cg/intel/386** ).


There are several macros for emitting binary opcodes:


_Code;


. . .


_Next;


. . .


_Emit;


Opcodes are inserted using the special functions, e.g.:


void LayOpbyte( opcode op );


void LayOpword( opcode op );


void LayReg( hw_reg_set r );


void LayRegOp( name *r );


void LayRMRegOp( name *r );


**Sample:** Generating **PUSHF**


_Code;


LayOpbyte( 0x9C );


_Emit;


However, there are more digestible functions for common cases, e.g. **GenRegMove()** .


The information above should give the basic knowledge to the developer unfamiliar with CG386. The last
uncovered topic is how object files are produced.


Unfortunately the only object format supported is OMF. Therefore many things in CG386 are rigidly bound
to OMF structure. OMF output is implemented mostly in **$OWROOT/bld/cg/intel/c/i86obj.c**, **i86esc.c**,
and **$OWROOT/bld/cg/c/posixio.c** .

But there is last but one stage, before data became written to the object file. This stage is optimizing
(although some optimizations were performed during previous stages). The optimizer
( **$OWROOT/bld/cg/c/opt*.c** ) has the operations queue. The “trace” below shows intercommunications
between the optimizer and OMF output routines (for well-known “Hello, world!” program):


#include <stdio.h>


int main(void) {


printf("Hello, world!\n");


return 0;


}

This trace shows how OMF object file is written in **i86obj.c** . We will refer to this trace in the latter
sections.


OMF file is composed of object records. These records contain miscellaneous linking information, e.g.:


**EXTDEF** External Names Definition Record (imported symbols)


**PUBDEF** Public Names Definition Record (exported symbols)


**SEGDEF** Segment Definition Record (describes a logical segment)


**GRPDEF** Group Definition Record (segments to be collected together)


**FIXUPP** Fixup Record (relocations)


**BAKPAT** Backpatch Record (relocations)


**LEDATA** Logical Enumerated Data Record (binary code or data)


Actual writing is performed by **void PutObjRec( byte class, byte *buff, uint len )** located in **posixio.c** .
For example, class of **LEDATA** is either **0xA0** or **0xA1** .

**2.5 OWL**


_2.5.1 Definition_

Abbreviation of “Object Writing Library”. Located in **$OWROOT/bld/owl** .


OWL is designed for writing object files in ELF and COFF formats. We are interested mainly in the ELF
( **owelf.c** ). However, OWL is not an abstract wrapper (like ORL). But rather a set of data structures and
functions, useful for creating object files.


_2.5.2 Description_

OWL is currently used by RISC code generators (Alpha AXP and PowerPC). As mentioned above, OWL is
not currently used by CG386.


OWL provides set of useful functions for creating ELF object files. These functions cover sections,
symbols, and relocations. For understanding OWL, one can examine **$OWROOT/bld/cg/risc/c/rscobj.c** .


For example, **void OWLEmitReloc( owl_section_handle section, owl_offset offset, owl_symbol_handle**
**sym, owl_reloc_type type )** is intended to add new relocation to the specified section. Relocation type is
defined in OWL terms:


$OWROOT/bld/owl/h/owl.h


typedef enum {


OWL_RELOC_ABSOLUTE,    // ref to a 32-bit absolute address


OWL_RELOC_WORD,      // a direct ref to a 32-bit address


OWL_RELOC_HALF_HI,    // ref to high half of 32-bit address


OWL_RELOC_PAIR,      // pair - used to indicate prev hi and next lo
linked


OWL_RELOC_HALF_LO,    // ref to low half of 32-bit address


OWL_RELOC_BRANCH_REL,   // relative branch (Alpha: 21-bit; PPC: 14-bit)


OWL_RELOC_BRANCH_ABS,   // absolute branch (Alpha: not used; PPC: 14-bit)


OWL_RELOC_JUMP_REL,    // relative jump (Alpha: 14-bit hint; PPC: 24bit)


OWL_RELOC_JUMP_ABS,    // absolute jump (Alpha: not used; PPC:24-bit)


OWL_RELOC_SECTION_OFFSET, // offset of item within it's section


// meta reloc


OWL_RELOC_SECTION_INDEX, // index of section within COFF file


OWL_RELOC_TOC_OFFSET,   // 16-bit offset within TOC (PPC)


OWL_RELOC_GLUE,      // location of NOP for GLUE code


OWL_RELOC_FP_OFFSET,   // cheesy hack for inline assembler


} owl_reloc_type;

These abstract types are mapped to ELF relocation types:


$OWROOT/bld/owl/c/owreloc.c


static Elf32_Word elfRelocTypes386[] = {


R_386_NONE,


R_386_32,


R_386_NONE,


R_386_NONE,


R_386_NONE,


R_386_PC32,


R_386_NONE,

R_386_NONE,


R_386_32,


R_386_32,


R_386_GOT32,


R_386_NONE,


};


As shown above, OWL is intended primarily to RISC support, so many 386 ABI features are missing or
incomplete.

**3. Porting Open Watcom C Compiler and Linker to Linux**

The porting task was originally defined as:

        - Add PIC support to the compiler.

        - Implement building of shared objects (both PIC and PDC).

        - Implement using of existing shared objects.


This task was defined with the assumption Open Watcom is already able to build ELF files (i.e. suitable for
Linux). This is almost true, but there are two problems:

        - Some bugs (in **open_watcom_devel_1.1.7** ) causing problems in building ELF executables (even
“Hello, world!”).

        - The only object file format produced by CG386 is OMF.


The first problem is, of course, temporary. After fixing the mentioned bugs, it is possible to build ELF
executable from OMF and ELF object files and e.g. **dietlibc** library.


However, the second problem is more serious. It affects the perspective of PIC implementation (and
therefore, building of “real” shared objects). The corresponding issues are described in the latter sections.


**3.1 Position-Independent Code**

PIC stands for Position-Independent Code. The functions in a shared library may be loaded at different
addresses in different programs, so the code in the shared object must not depend on the address (or
position) at which it is loaded. Fortunately, on x86 platform all jumps are PC-relative (except for the
indirect ones). There are, however, some problems with:

        - functions exported by a shared object;

        - indirect function calls, i.e. **(*f)()** ;

        - global variables (including **static** ones).


These problems are solved (in 386 ABI) mostly by introducing special relocation types. These relocation
types are specific to ELF object files, there are no their equivalents in OMF.


There are three possible workarounds:

        - introducing OMF extensions for PIC support;

        - adding ELF output to CG386 (using OWL);

        - writing new code generator with ELF output (based on CG386), like RISC ones.


The first approach is the simplest from implementation perspective. But we will get a non-standard object
file format, alien to both Linux and Windows worlds. Therefore such approach should be ommited.


The third approach seems too hard to implement, since CG386 is the most complex code generator. And it
seems impractical to have two branches of CG386 that differ only in the output format.


So the second approach is the best option. There are three subtasks needed for PIC support:

        - introducing new command line switches in **wcc386** (for ELF and PIC);

        - implementing output of ELF object files in CG386;

        - implementing PIC (according to 386 ABI) in CG386.


Of course, changes to Open Watcom Linker are needed as well. But **wlink** is described in other sections.
Moreover, we can use **ld** to build shared object from ELFs produced by **wcc386** .

_3.1.1 Command Line Switches_

There are no ELF and PIC switches in Open Watcom C Compiler. In **gcc**, ELF is default format of object
files, and PIC generation is turned on by either **-fPIC** or **-fpic** .


Since command line of **wcc386** differs from **gcc** very much, we may follow the “Watcom style”. For ELF,
perhaps the best option is **-elf** . The “el” prefix is free, since the “nearest” options are **-ei** and **-em** . And this
choice is logical, because the option **-ez** stands for “generate PharLap EZ-OMF object files”.


For PIC, the GNU style seems unacceptable, since “fp” prefix is intended for floating-point options.
Especially, **-fpi** means “inline 80x87 instructions with emulation”. Like in the ELF case, simply **-pic** may
be acceptable (however, “p” prefixes preprocessor options). As alternative, **-zpic** seems a good choice,
since “z” groups very specific options. There is also **-re** switch (already implemented). This switch is
mapped to **POSITION_INDEPENDANT** option in CG386, but nothing reasonable is performed when it
is turned on.


Finally, our switch should be passed from **wcc386** to CG386. The interesting files are:
**$OWROOT/bld/cc/c/coptions.c, cgen2.c, $OWROOT/bld/cg/h/cgswitch.h, and**
**$OWROOT/bld/cg/intel/h/cgi86swi.h** . In the compiler, switches are stored in **CompFlags** variable. Other
important variables are **GenSwitches** and (especially) **TargetSwitches** .


Switches are passed to CG386 in **cgen2.c** :


void DoCompile()


{


// ...


cgi_info = BEInit( GenSwitches, TargetSwitches, OptSize,
ProcRevision );


// ...


}


_3.1.2 ELF Object Files_

Since Open Watcom already contains OWL with ELF support, it is planned to use this library in CG386.
Both CG386 and OWL were described briefly in the previous sections.


Many things in CG386 are rigidly bound to OMF structure. OMF output is implemented mostly in
**$OWROOT/bld/cg/intel/c/i86obj.c**, **i86esc.c**, and **$OWROOT/bld/cg/c/posixio.c** . However, any object
file format defines virtually the same objects: groups, segments, symbols, relocations, etc. The biggest
conceptual difference between OMF and ELF is relocation handling. But the opposite problem was
successfully solved in ORL and WLCore. So we can implement the same “mapping” approach in CG386,
avoiding harmful changes to the complicated code generator.


The sample trace (see section CG386) shows how OMF object file is created.


Code and data (i.e. binary payload) are written by **EjectLEData()** . Although there are many calls of this
function in the trace, data are written when the following condition is true: **obj->data.used > CurrSeg-**
**>data_prefix_size** . Instead of calling **PutObjRec()**, we will call **OWLEmitData()** . Note that fix-ups are
written in **EjectLEData()** as well. So **OWLEmitReloc()** should be used to write relocations.


Sample mapping between **i86obj.c** and OWL is shown below. Each entry means that we _can_ use specified
OWL function for OMF task, so there is no direct correspondence between columns.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 34 of 55|

|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


|OMF|OWL|
|---|---|
|DefSegment()|OWLSectionInit()|
|EjectImports()|OWLEmitImport()|
|EjectExports()|OWLEmitExport()|
|OutLabel()|OWLSymbolInit()|


RISC object code, located in **$OWROOT/bld/$OWROOT/bld/rscobj.c** . can be used as a reference.


Unfortunately OWL is RISC-oriented, so missing features should be added. There are some relocation
types missing in the current OWL. These relocations are described in the next section. Abstract relocation
types are defined in **owl.h** . The mapping between OWL relocations and 386 ABI is defined in **owreloc.c** :


static Elf32_Word elfRelocTypes386[] = {


R_386_NONE,


R_386_32,


R_386_NONE,


R_386_NONE,


R_386_NONE,


R_386_PC32,


R_386_NONE,


R_386_NONE,


R_386_NONE,


R_386_32,


R_386_32,


R_386_GOT32,


R_386_NONE,


};


Since some relocations are 386-specific, the corresponding constants to both files should be added. In
addition, new fixup flags are needed for the mapping between OMF-style fixups and OWL relocations.
Extending fixups seems to be the hardest part of this subtask.


The only remark is that OWL in **open_watcom_devel_1.1.7** seemed to be under development, i.e. some
features are incomplete.

_3.1.3 PIC Generation_

GOT base register


The **EBX** register serves as the global offset table base register for position-independent code. So this
register should be excluded from normal code generation.


Register macros were described in CG386 section. The following template illustrates turning off **EBX** .


$OWROOT/bld/cg/intel/386/c/386rgtbl.c


extern hw_reg_set   FixedRegs() {


/************************************


return the set of register which may not be modified within this routine


*/


hw_reg_set fixed;


// ...


HW_CTurnOn( fixed, HW_EBX ); // PIC


return( fixed );


}


extern hw_reg_set   AllCacheRegs() {


/***************************************


return the set of all registers that could be used to cache values


*/


hw_reg_set all;


// ...


HW_CTurnOff( all, HW_EBX ); // PIC


return( all );


}


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 36 of 55|

|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


Position-Independent Function Prologue


prologue:


pushl  %ebp


movl  %esp, %ebp


subl  $80, %esp


pushl  %edi


pushl  %esi


pushl  %ebx


call  .L1


.L1:  popl  %ebx


addl  $_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+[.-.L1], %ebx


The **call** instruction pushes the absolute address of the next instruction onto the stack.


Consequently, the **popl** instruction pops the absolute address of **.L1** into register **%ebx** .


The last instruction computes the desired absolute value into **%ebx** . This works because
**_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_** in the expression gives the distance from the **addl** instruction to the
global offset table; **[.-.L1]** gives the distance from **.L1** to the **addl** instruction. Adding their sum to the
absolute address of **.L1**, already in **%ebx**, gives the absolute address of the global offset table.


The last line seems a bit complicated, since there is address calculation. But actually this line should be **add**
**$0x3,%ebx**, where immediate is the explicit addend for **R_386_GOTPC** relocation. Note that code
generator should create the undefined symbol **_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_**, if **R_386_GOTPC**
encountered.


Prologues are handled in **$OWROOT/bld/cg/intel/c/i86proc.c**, so needed code should be added to **void**
**GenProlog( void )** .


Template:


pointer lbl;


// ...


AllocStack();


AdjustPushLocals();


// PIC


lbl = AskForNewLabel();


GenCallLabel( lbl );


CodeLabel( lbl, 0 );


QuickSave( HW_EBX, OP_POP );


GenRegAdd( HW_EBX, 3 );


// Add relocation R_386_GOTPC


GenKillLabel( lbl );


///PIC


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 37 of 55|
|---|---|
|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


In addition, register **EBX** should be saved in the stack. There is variable **to_push** in **GenProlog()**, so the
needed code is: **HW_CTurnOn( to_push, HW_EBX )** .


Moreover, 386 ABI notes that **EBX**, **ESI**, and **EDI** should be saved in the stack, for both PIC and PDC.


Of course, PIC actions depend on CG386 switch for PIC. So conditional processing as well should be also
added.


Position-Independent Function Epilogue

All registers previously saved in stack (see above) should be resotred.


Although epilogue is created in **void GenEpilog( void )**, the interesting function is **void DoEpilog( void )** .
Both are defined in **$OWROOT/bld/cg/intel/c/i86proc.c** .


There is variable **to_pop**, defining the register set to be popped.


PIC Function Calls

Function calls are handled in **$OWROOT/bld/cg/intel/c/i86call.c** . There is also important function **void**
**AddCallIns( instruction *ins, cn call )** located in **$OWROOT/bld/cg/c/bldcall.c** .


Since ELF-specific relocations are not implemented yet, there is no code template. However, the task is
simple. For PDC, the target address has **R_386_PC32** relocation. For PIC, this relocation should be
**R_386_PLT32** . The corresponding GNU assembler line is **call function@PLT** .


The information above covers direct function calls. Indirect function calls are kind of PIC data access
described below.


PIC Data Access

This task covers accessing the global data (including **extern** and **static** ). Position-independent instructions
cannot contain absolute addresses. Instead, instructions that reference symbols hold the symbols’ offsets
into the global offset table. Combining the offset with the global offset table address in **EBX** gives the
absolute address of the table entry holding the desired address.








|Sample|PDC|PIC|
|---|---|---|
|extern int src;<br>extern int dst;<br>extern int *ptr;<br>ptr = &dst;<br> <br> <br> <br>*ptr = src;|.globl  src, dst, ptr<br> <br> <br>movl    $dst, ptr<br> <br> <br> <br>movl    ptr, %eax<br>movl    src, %edx<br>movl    %edx, (%eax)|.globl  src, dst, ptr<br> <br> <br>movl    ptr@GOT(%ebx), %eax<br>movl    dst@GOT(%ebx), %edx<br>movl    %edx, (%eax)<br> <br>movl    ptr@GOT(%ebx), %eax<br>movl    (%eax), %eax<br>movl    src@GOT(%ebx), %edx<br>movl    (%edx), %edx<br>movl    %edx, (%eax)|



Although references like **name@GOT** seem complicated, their meaning is simple, e.g. **mov  0x0(%ebx),**
**%eax**, where **0x0** is addend for relocation **R_386_GOT32**, associated with symbol **ptr** . For PDC,
relocation type is **R_386_32**, and generated code is much simpler.


Finally, position-independent references to static data may be optimized. Because **EBX** holds a known
address, the global offset table, a program may use it as a base register. External references should use the
global offset table entry, because dynamic linking may bind the entry to a definition outside the current
object file’s scope. For **static** variables, the PIC code will be the following:


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 38 of 55|
|---|---|
|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


leal  ptr@GOTOFF(%ebx), %eax


leal  dst@GOTOFF(%ebx), %edx


movl  %edx, (%eax)


movl  ptr@GOTOFF(%ebx), %eax


movl  src@GOTOFF(%ebx), %edx


movl  %edx, (%eax)


Again, references **name@GOTOFF** actually correspond to relocations **R_386_GOTOFF**, where
relocation symbol is the segment (e.g. **.bss** ), and implicit addend is offset of **name** in this segment.


There is no code template for data access. This task is most complicated, so additional investigation is
needed. PIC data access might affect the common code generator (not only CG386). In general, PIC global
variable should be treated as pointer to the actual address instead of address itself.


One potentially useful function is **AddGlobalIndex()** located in
**$OWROOT/bld/cg/intel/386/c/386opseg.c** . This function adds **EBX** to every memory reference.


Summary


For PIC support, code generator should be able to produce some specific relocations (in addition to
**R_386_32** and **R_386_PC32** ). These relocations are summarized below (now from the perspective of link
editor).

|R_386_GOT32|This relocation type computes the distance from the base of the global offset table to the<br>symbol’s global offset table entry. It additionally instructs the link editor to build a global<br>offset table.|
|---|---|
|**R_386_GOTOFF**|This relocation type computes the difference between a symbol’s value and the address of the<br>global offset table. It additionally instructs the link editor to build the global offset table.|
|**R_386_GOTPC**|This relocation type resembles**R_386_PC32**, except it uses the address of the global offset<br>table in its calculation. The symbol referenced in this relocation normally is<br>**_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_**, which additionally instructs the link editor to build the<br>global offset table.|
|**R_386_PLT32**|This relocation type computes the address of the symbol’s procedure linkage table entry and<br>additionally instructs the link editor to build a procedure linkage table.|



_3.1.4 Notes_


The information presented in the sections above should not be treated as retelling of 386 ABI. It should be
used together with ABI documentation. Some details are omitted. During the porting work, developer
should refer to ABI and other documentation; perform analysis using **objdump** and **readelf** ; etc.

**3.2 Building Shared Objects**

This section describes the changes to Open Watcom Linker, needed for building shared libraries (PIC and
PDC).


_3.2.1 Linker Command Line_

Fortunately, the command line option for building a shared object is already implemented in Open Watcom
Linker. In such case, one should execute the linker this way: **wlink form ELF DLL ...**


**DLL** stands for Dynamic Linking Library that is shared object in the Linux world. One can check that ELF
shared object was requested by examining **FmtData** :


if( (FmtData.type & MK_ELF) && FmtData.dll ) {


// Do something...


}


_3.2.2 ELF Header_

Currently, LoadELF is able to produce only executable files ( **ET_EXEC** ). Shared objects have type
**ET_DYN** . The following change is needed:


$OWROOT/bld/wl/c/loadelf.c


static void SetHeaders( ElfHdr *hdr )


/***********************************/


{


// ...


hdr->eh.e_type = FmtData.dll ? ET_DYN : ET_EXEC;


// ...


}


_3.2.3 Segments and Sections_

This is only a sample. Coding tasks are described in latter sections.


ELF executables created by **wlink** are organized in the following way (output from **readelf -a** ):


Program Headers:


Type      Offset  VirtAddr  PhysAddr  FileSiz MemSiz Flg Align


PHDR      0x000034 0x08048034 0x00000000 0x????? 0x????? R E 0


LOAD      0x?????? 0x080????? 0x00000000 0x????? 0x????? R E 0x1000


LOAD      0x?????? 0x080????? 0x00000000 0x????? 0x????? RW 0x1000


Section to Segment mapping:


Segment Sections...


00


01   .text


02   .data .bss


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 40 of 55|
|---|---|
|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


Shared objects created by **ld** are organized in the following way (complete
example):


Program Headers:


Type      Offset  VirtAddr  PhysAddr  FileSiz MemSiz Flg Align


LOAD      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x????? 0x????? R E 0x1000


LOAD      0x?????? 0x???????? 0x???????? 0x????? 0x????? RW 0x1000


DYNAMIC    0x?????? 0x???????? 0x???????? 0x????? 0x????? RW 0x4


Section to Segment mapping:


Segment Sections...


00   .hash .dynsym .dynstr .rel.dyn .rel.plt .plt .text .rodata


01   .data .dynamic .got .bss


02   .dynamic


We will refer to these samples from other sections of this document.


_3.2.4 Program Headers_

Unnecessary **PT_PHDR**


Since shared object is not a program, the program header entry **PT_PHDR** is not needed. Program headers
are allocated in **SetHeaders()**, and the first element is always **PT_PHDR** .


Template:


static void SetHeaders( ElfHdr *hdr )


/***********************************/


{


hdr->eh.e_phnum = NumGroups + (FmtData.dll ? 0 : 1);


// ...


if( !FmtData.dll ) {


hdr->ph->p_type = PT_PHDR;


hdr->ph->p_offset = sizeof(Elf32_Ehdr);


hdr->ph->p_vaddr = sizeof(Elf32_Ehdr) + FmtData.base;


hdr->ph->p_paddr = 0;


hdr->ph->p_filesz = hdr->ph_size;


hdr->ph->p_memsz = hdr->ph_size;


hdr->ph->p_flags = PF_R | PF_X;


hdr->ph->p_align = 0;


}


// ...


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 41 of 55|
|---|---|
|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


}


But **PT_PHDR** is assumed in **WriteELFGroups()**, so that function should be changed as well: **ph = hdr-**
**>ph + (FmtData.dll ? 0 : 1)** .


Necessary **PT_DYNAMIC**


Although **PT_PHDR** is never used in shared objects, **PT_DYNAMIC** is always used there. This program
header specifies dynamic linking information.


Therefore we can leave **hdr->eh.e_phnum = NumGroups + 1**, for executable and shared object.
Following the GNU convention, we will place dynamic segment after other segments.


_3.2.5 Dynamic Section_

The **PT_DYNAMIC** segment contains the **.dynamic** section. This section (with type **SHT_DYNAMIC** )
contains an array of the following structures.


$OWROOT/bld/watcom/h/exeelf.h


typedef struct {


Elf32_Sword     d_tag;


union {


Elf32_Word   d_val;


Elf32_Addr   d_ptr;


} d_un;


} Elf32_Dyn;


// dynamic array tags


#define DT_NULL     0


#define DT_NEEDED    1        // name of a needed library


#define DT_PLTRELSZ   2        // size of reloc entries for PLT


#define DT_PLTGOT    3        // address with PLT or GOT


#define DT_HASH     4        // symbol hash table address


#define DT_STRTAB    5        // string table address


#define DT_SYMTAB    6        // symbol table address


#define DT_RELA     7        // address of reloc table with addends


#define DT_RELASZ    8        // size of the DT_RELA table


#define DT_RELAENT   9        // size of a DT_RELA entry


#define DT_STRSZ    10       // size of the string table


#define DT_SYMENT    11       // size of a symbol table entry


#define DT_SONAME    14       // shared object name


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 42 of 55|
|---|---|
|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


#define DT_REL     17       // address of reloc table without
addends


#define DT_RELSZ    18       // size of the DT_REL table


#define DT_RELENT    19       // size of a DT_REL entry


#define DT_PLTREL    20       // type of reloc entry for PLT


#define DT_DEBUG    21       // for debugging information


#define DT_JMPREL    23       // reloc entries only with PLT


This section should reside in the data segment. We can create this section at the end of first linker pass (as
segment in **DGROUP** ). This section will be written later using LoadELF. Additionally, the program header
**PT_DYNAMIC** should be updated.


_3.2.6 Dynamic Symbols_


Shared objects contain two symbol tables (i.e. sections): normal symbol table ( **SHT_SYMTAB** ), and
dynamic symbol table ( **SHT_DYNSYM** ). The name of dynamic symbol table is **.dynsym** instead of
**.symtab** .


Both are generally the same, but dynamic table does not contain local symbols (except sections). Of course,
the corresponding string table should be created ( **.dynstr** instead of **.strtab** ). For shared objects, section
**.hash** is related to dynamic symbol table.


Some changes are needed to **WriteElfSymTable()**, located in **loadelf2.c** . Function **WriteSHStrings()** from
**loadelf.c** should be changed as well. These changes include providing virtual addresses of the
corresponding sections (there is no memory allocation for normal symbol table), and supporting different
section names and types. Like normal symbol table, two variables are needed for dynamic table:


$OWROOT/bld/wl/h/loadelf.c


static stringtable   SymStrTab;


static ElfSymTable *  ElfSymTab;


static stringtable   DynStrTab; // new


static ElfSymTable *  DynSymTab; // new


The corresponding changes are needed to **void InitSections( ElfHdr *hdr )** (i.e. allocating **.dynsym** and
**.dynstr** ), and to **void ChkElfData( void )** (i.e. initializing dynamic symbol table). ELF handle should be
modified as well:


$OWROOT/bld/wl/h/loadelf2.h


typedef struct {


Elf32_Ehdr eh;


// ...


stringtable secstrtab;


struct {


int    secstr; // Index of strings section for section names


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 43 of 55|
|---|---|
|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


int    grpbase; // Index base for Groups in section


int    grpnum; // Number of groups


int    relbase; // Index base for relocation sections


int    relnum; // number of relocations


int    symstr; // Index of symbol's string table


int    symtab; // Index of symbol table


int    symhash; // Index of symbol hash table


int    dynsym; // Index of dynamic symbol's string table


int    dynstr; // Index of dynamic symbol table


int    dbgbegin;// Index of first debug section


int    dbgnum; // Number of debug sections


} i; // Indexes into sh


unsigned_32 curr_off;


} ElfHdr;


Finally, the dynamic array should be updated (i.e. **DT_HASH**, **DT_STRTAB**, **DT_SYMTAB**,
**DT_STRSZ**, and **DT_SYMENT** ).


_3.2.7 Dynamic Relocations_


Relocations are written using **WriteRelocsSections()** . However, a shared object should contain single
relocation table **.rel.dyn** . So the new function, say **WriteDynRelocsSection()**, is needed. This function
should merge all relocations into single table. It should update **.dynamic** section as well (i.e. either
**DT_RELA**, **DT_RELASZ**, **DT_RELAENT** or **DT_REL**, **DT_RELSZ**, **DT_RELENT** ). Note that the
current implementation of **WriteRelocsSections()** generates only “rela” relocations (i.e. explicit addend).


Template


// Initialize sh and its fields


// ...


AddSecName( hdr, sh, ".rela.dyn" );


for( group = Groups; group != NULL; group = group->next_group ) {


relocs = group->g.grp_relocs;


if( relocs != NULL ) {


size = RelocSize( relocs );


sh->sh_size += size;


DumpRelocList( relocs );


hdr->curr_off += size;


}


currgrp++;

_3.2.8 Global Offset Table_

When link editor encounters one of the following relocation types:

        - **R_386_GOT32**

        - **R_386_GOTOFF**

        - **R_386_GOTPC**


it should build the Global Offset Table. Additionally **wlink** should process this relocation types according
to 386 ABI.


GOT is defined as **Elf32_Addr _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_[]** .


The table’s entry zero is reserved to hold the address of the dynamic structure, referenced with the symbol
**_DYNAMIC** . Entries one and two in the global offset table also are reserved.


One should add support of these relocation types to both ORL and WLCore. For ORL, introduce new
constants in **orlglobl.h**, e.g.: **ORL_RELOC_TYPE_GOT_32**, **ORL_RELOC_TYPE_GOT_OFF**,
**ORL_RELOC_TYPE_GOT_REL** . Then extend the mapping between ELF and ORL ( **elflwlv.c** ).


Then the mapping between **ORL_** and **FIX_** should be added to **DoReloc()**, **objorl.c** . Of course, new **FIX_**
constants are needed as well ( **obj2supp.h** ).


Relocation processing is performed in **obj2supp.c** . Some preprocessing is performed in **objorl.c** as well.


Relocation types mentioned above are processed in the following way.


**A** This means the addend used to compute the value of the relocatable field.


**G** This means the offset into the global offset table at which the address of the relocation entry’s
symbol will reside during execution.


**GOT** This means the address of the global offset table.


**S** This means the value of the symbol whose index resides in the relocation entry.

|R_386_GOT32|G + A - P|
|---|---|
|R_386_GOTOFF|S + A - GOT|
|R_386_GOTPC|GOT + A - P|



As shown in the table, **R_386_GOT32** and **R_386_GOTPC** are processed very close to **R_386_PC32** ( **S +**
**A - P** ). This mean both are **FIX_OFFSET_32 | FIX_REL** . Similarly, **R_386_GOTOFF** should be
**FIX_OFFSET_32** . Of course, additional **FIX_** flags are needed to distinguish them for further processing
in **obj2supp.c** .


We can build the GOT during ORL conversion, i.e. in **DoReloc()** . During this phase, symbol offsets into
the GOT are calculated.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 45 of 55|
|---|---|
|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


At the end of first linker pass, we can create the **.got** section (i.e. segment in **DGROUP** ). At this time,
**_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_** symbol should be defined as well. This allows creating the GOT with
minimal changes to the source code.


For unresolved external symbols, GOT entries are needed as well. Linker should create
**R_386_GLOB_DAT** relocations for such GOT entries. These relocations are associated with unresolved
symbols.


Another relocation type that can appear in shared object is **R_386_RELATIVE** . Its offset member gives a
location within a shared object that contains a value representing a relative address. The dynamic linker
computes the corresponding virtual address by adding the virtual address at which the shared object was
loaded to the relative address. Such relocations are created from **R_386_GOT32**, if the corresponding
symbol is not external.


In this section, only GOT aspects related with data were described. Code aspects are described in the next
section.


Finally, the dynamic array should be updated ( **PLTGOT** ).


Note that there is PowerPC TOC implementation in Open Watcom Linker. TOC is close to GOT in some
sense, but in general it is different thing. However, developer should take a look at existing TOC
implementation, since it contains some useful ideas.


_3.2.9 Procedure Linkage Table_

PLT is like GOT in some sense, but it is associated with PIC code instead of PIC data. Although 386 ABI
defines PLT for PDC and PIC, only PIC PLT is needed for our current task:


.PLT0: pushl  4(%ebx)


jmp   *8(%ebx)


nop; nop


nop; nop


.PLT1: jmp   *name1@GOT(%ebx)


pushl  $offset


jmp   .PLT0@PC


.PLT2: jmp   *name2@GOT(%ebx)


pushl  $offset


jmp   .PLT0@PC


...


**.PLT0@PC** in each entry means the distance between the corresponding **jmp** and **.PLT0**, since x86 jumps
are PC-relative.


The GOT entry should be created for each PLT entry. Such GOT entry should contain the address of the
following **pushl** instruction, not the real address of e.g. **name1** . Thus **name1@GOT** means the offset of
the corresponding GOT entry.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 46 of 55|
|---|---|
|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


A new **R_386_JUMP_SLOT** relocation should be created. Its offset will specify the global offset table
entry used in the previous **jmp** instruction. The relocation entry also contains a symbol table index, thus
telling the dynamic linker what symbol is being referenced, e.g. **name1** . Instructions **pushl  $offset** pushes
the offset of such relocation in the PLT relocation table ( **rel.plt** ).


When first creating the memory image of the program, the dynamic linker sets the second and the third
entries in the global offset table to special values. Therefore these entries are reserved.


Since PLT contains instruction opcodes, an implementation template is presented for advice:


typedef struct pltent1 {


unsigned_16 push_ins;


unsigned_32 push_ofs;


unsigned_16 jmp_ins;


unsigned_32 jmp_ofs;


unsigned_32 nops;


} PLTENT1;


typedef struct pltentn {


unsigned_16 jmp1_ins;


unsigned_32 jmp1_ofs;


unsigned_8 push_ins;


unsigned_32 push_ofs;


unsigned_8 jmp2_ins;


unsigned_32 jmp2_ofs;


} PLTENTN;


typedef union pltent {


PLTENT1   first;


PLTENTN   entry;


} PLTENT;


typedef struct plt {


unsigned  nentries;


PLTENT   *entries;


} PLT;


void InitPLT ( PLT *plt ) {


plt->entries = AllocMem( sizeof( PLTENT ) );


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 47 of 55|
|---|---|
|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


plt->entries[0].first.push_ins = 0xB3FF;


plt->entries[0].first.push_ofs = 0x00000004;


plt->entries[0].first.jmp_ins = 0xA3FF;


plt->entries[0].first.jmp_ofs = 0x00000008;


plt->entries[0].first.nops   = 0x90909090;


plt->nentries = 1;


}


void Add2PLT ( PLT *plt, unsigned_32 gotoff) {


static unsigned_32 reloff = 0;


plt->entries = ReallocMem( plt->entries, (plt->nentries + 1) * sizeof(
PLTENT ) );


plt->entries[plt->nentries].entry.jmp1_ins = 0xA3FF;


plt->entries[plt->nentries].entry.jmp1_ofs = gotoff;


plt->entries[plt->nentries].entry.push_ins = 0x68;


plt->entries[plt->nentries].entry.push_ofs = reloff; reloff += sizeof(
Elf32_Rel );


// Add R_386_JUMP_SLOT relocation for push_ofs (somehow)...


plt->entries[plt->nentries].entry.jmp2_ins = 0xE9;


plt->entries[plt->nentries].entry.jmp2_ofs = -0x10 - plt->nentries *
sizeof( PLTENT );


plt->nentries++;


}


When relocation **R_386_PLT32** is encountered, the linker should create new PLT entry for the
corresponding symbol (but only if its type is **STT_FUNC** ). For further references to the same symbol, we
will refer to the previously created PLT entry. **R_386_PLT32** relocations are processed as **L + A - P**,
where **L** means the place (section offset or address) of the procedure linkage table entry for a symbol, **A**
and **P** were defined in the previous section. The corresponding ORL type,
**ORL_RELOC_TYPE_PLT_32**, is already defined (but not implemented yet). This is relative type, so the
mapping should include **FIX_OFFSET_32 | FIX_REL** . Source files and functions participating in
relocation process were described in the previous section.


At the end of first linker pass, we can create the **.plt** section (i.e. segment in **AUTO** group). This allows
creating the PLT with minimal changes to the source code. Note that the separated relocation section
( **.rel.plt** ) is needed for PLT relocations. This relocation table should also reside in the code segment.


Finally, the dynamic array should be updated ( **PLTRELSZ**, **PLTREL**, and **JMPREL** ).

_3.2.10 Notes_

The information presented in the sections above should not be treated as retelling of 386 ABI. It should be
used together with ABI documentation. Some details are omitted, e.g. section flags for the dynamic section.
During the porting work, developer should refer to ABI and other documentation; perform analysis using
**objdump** and **readelf** ; etc.


Note that symbol types ( **STT_** ) are very important for dynamic linking tasks. For example, **STT_FUNC** is
closely related with PLT. The current implementation (i.e. **open_watcom_devel_1.1.7** ) sometimes loses
symbol types, so such issues need to be fixed.


**3.3 Using Shared Objects**

This section describes the changes to Open Watcom Linker, needed for using existing shared libraries (PIC
and PDC). Note that a shared library may use other shared libraries as well.


Since many things are related to building shared libraries (which is covered in the provious sections of this
document), this section is sufficiently short.


_3.3.1 Reading Shared Objects_

Shared object is another kind of ELF object file. ORL is able to read ELF object files. Some features
related to shared objects are implemented as well. Thus **wlink** fails (i.e. **Segmentation fault** ) when one
tries to link a shared object. ORL should be reviewed and fixed in respective to these issues.


Additionally, the linker should collect the names of shared objects for further processing (see "Needed
Libraries" below). If this list is non-empty, the linker should perform some tasks described in the further
sections.


_3.3.2 Program Interpreter_

The additional program header **PT_INTERP** is needed for an executable that uses shared object(s). It
specifies the location and size of a null-terminated path name to invoke as an interpreter. This segment type
is meaningful only for executable files (though it may occur for shared objects); it may not occur more than
once in a file. If it is present, it must precede any loadable segment entry. For Linux, the program
interpreter is **/lib/ld-linux.so.2**


The needed changes in LoadELF are simple and obvious.


_3.3.3 Required Libraries_

The additional element of the dynamic array (i.e. **.dynamic** section) is needed. When the dynamic linker
creates the memory segments for an object file, the dependencies (recorded in **DT_NEEDED** entries of the
dynamic structure) tell what shared objects are needed to supply the program’s services.


**DT_NEEDED** holds the string table offset of a null-terminated string, giving the name of a needed library.
The offset is an index into the table recorded in the **DT_STRTAB** entry. The dynamic array may contain
multiple entries with this type. These entries’ relative order is significant, though their relation to entries of
other types is not.


Dynamic array is described in the previous sections.

|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


_3.3.4 Global Offset Table_

The GOT processing is described in previous section. If any specific relocation is encountered, the linker
should resolve them and create the Global Offset Table. See also the next section.


_3.3.5 Procedure Linkage Table_

The PLT processing is described in previous section. If any specific relocation is encountered, the linker
should resolve them and create the Procedure Linkage Table.


There is, however, one important case not covered in the previous sections. If PDC shared object is needed
for the program, the linker creates PDC PLT. Its format differs from PIC PLT:


.PLT0: pushl  got_plus_4


jmp   *got_plus_8


nop; nop


nop; nop


.PLT1: jmp   *name1_in_GOT


pushl  $offset


jmp   .PLT0@PC


.PLT2: jmp   *name2_in_GOT


pushl  $offset


jmp   .PLT0@PC


...


Here **got_plus_4** and **got_plus_8** specify explicit addresses of the second and third GOT entries,
respectively. Similarly, **name1_in_GOT** specifies address of the GOT entry for **name1** .


Instead of implementation template (very similar to PIC one), a sample disassembly is presented:


08048224 <.plt>:


8048224:    ff 35 b4 93 04 08    pushl 0x80493b4 ;&GOT[1]


804822a:    ff 25 b8 93 04 08    jmp  *0x80493b8 ; GOT[2]


8048230:    00 00


8048232:    00 00


8048234:    ff 25 bc 93 04 08    jmp  *0x80493bc ; GOT[3]


804823a:    68 00 00 00 00     push  $0x0


804823f:    e9 e0 ff ff ff     jmp  8048224


8048244:    ff 25 c0 93 04 08    jmp  *0x80493c0 ; GOT[4]


804824a:    68 08 00 00 00     push  $0x8


804824f:    e9 d0 ff ff ff     jmp  8048224

_3.3.6 Notes_

During the porting work, developer should refer to ABI and other documentation; perform analysis using
**objdump** and **readelf** ; etc.


Note that symbol types ( **STT_** ) are very important for dynamic linking tasks. For example, **STT_FUNC** is
closely related with PLT. The current implementation (i.e. **open_watcom_devel_1.1.7** ) sometimes loses
symbol types, so such issues need to be fixed.


**4. Existing Problems**

Several problems exist in **open_watcom_devel_1.1.7**, more precely, in the linker. So one is unable to make
even the “Hello, world!” program.


NOTE: By the time of the final revision of this document all the problems mentioned in this section were
fixed in the Open Watcom Perforce depot therefore altering an estimated time requirements. (See
estimation section).


_4.1.1 Support of R_386_PC32 relocations_

After linking, the relocated values are 4 less than they should be.


Gcc, nasm, and other Linux compilers typically generate the following:


e8 fc ff ff ff  call somefunc


( **0xfffffffc** is the implicit addend for **R386_PC32** relocation).


Watcom C typically generates the following (of course, in OMF format):


e8 00 00 00 00  call somefunc


$OWROOT/bld/wl/c/obj2supp.c


static bool CheckSpecials( fix_data *fix, frame_spec *targ )


/**********************************************************/


{


.   .   .


if( !(fix->type & FIX_REL) ) return FALSE;


.   .   .


fixsize = CalcFixupSize( fix->type );


off -= fixsize;


.   .   .


}


This algorithm introduces our 4-byte error. Such correction isn't needed for **ELF R386_PC32**, since
implicit addend is specified ( **0xfffffffc == -4** ).


QUICK FIX: Offset correction should be disabled in case implicit addend was specified.


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 51 of 55|
|---|---|
|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


$OWROOT/bld/wl/c/obj2supp.c


static bool CheckSpecials( fix_data *fix, frame_spec *targ )


/**********************************************************/


{


.   .   .


if( !(fix->type & FIX_REL) ) return FALSE;


.   .   .


fixsize = CalcFixupSize( fix->type );


if( fix->type & FIX_ADDEND_ZERO ) off -= fixsize; // quickfix #01


.   .   .


}


NOTE. This is temporary solution. New ORL relocation type (or option) is needed for a more accurate fix.
This bug was already fixed in the development source tree at the moment of writing this SRS.


_4.1.2 Support of STT_NOTYPE symbols_

Two of symbol types defined in ABI:


**STT_NOTYPE** The symbol's type is not specified.


**STT_FUNC** The symbol is associated with a function or other executable code.


Many of “real-life” ELF object files has symbols of **STT_NOTYPE**, e.g. **_start** in dietlibc's **start.o** . When
linking that sort of object files, Open Watcom Linker complains such symbols are not found. This error is
fatal.


**ORL** treats **STT_NOTYPE** and unknown symbol types as **ORL_SYM_TYPE_NONE** . This (somehow)
confuses the linker.


$OWROOT/bld/orl/elf/c/elflwlv.c


default:


current->type = ORL_SYM_TYPE_NONE; // ?


QUICK FIX: If symbol's associated section (i.e. **st_shndx** ) looks like executable, treat that symbol as
**ORL_SYM_TYPE_FUNCTION** .


$OWROOT/bld/orl/elf/c/elflwlv.c


orl_return ElfCreateSymbolHandles( elf_sec_handle elf_sec_hnd )


{


elf_sec_handle   sym_sec; // Nick's quickfix #02


.    .    .


default:


// hotfix #02


_SciTech Software, Inc._


|Open Watcom Linux Port|Page 52 of 55|
|---|---|
|_Compiler / Linker Software Requirements Specification_||


if( ( sym_sec = ElfSymbolGetSecHandle( current ) ) != NULL


&& sym_sec->type == ORL_SEC_TYPE_PROG_BITS


&& sym_sec->flags & ORL_SEC_FLAG_EXEC


) {


current->type = ORL_SYM_TYPE_FUNCTION;


} else {


current->type = ORL_SYM_TYPE_NONE;


}


NOTE. This workaround works pretty well for current version, but has some drawbacks in “shared
libraries” perspective. When another object file references a function from a shared object, the link editor
automatically creates a procedure linkage table entry for the referenced symbol. Shared object symbols
with types other than **STT_FUNC** will not be referenced automatically through the procedure linkage
table.


The accurate fix should treat **STT_NOTYPE** as “normal” symbol.


_4.1.3 Accurate segment mapping_

Sections **.data** and **.bss** share the same segment in ELF executables produced by **wlink** . If **.bss** section is
created, the memory size ( **p_memsz** ) of that segment became invalid. The produced ELF causes
segmentation fault.
