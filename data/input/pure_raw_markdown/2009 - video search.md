### **1. Introduction**

#### **1.1 Purpose**


This document will give a detailed description of the Video Searching software. The
software will be used to search multiple web sites for streaming videos and torrents
and return these results to the user.

This document will cover the features of the software and include specifics on what
the system will do and any constraints and external factors that might affect the
system.

#### **1.2 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions**


This document is intended for the developers of the system and project managers
as guide to building the software. It will also be used by the potential users of the
product to get their opinions on the software, this will help to revise and improve the
product.

The Overall Description will give an overview of the product functionality and
features. Also mentioned are the constraints that will affect the system and the
interface. This section will be used by the rest of the document and will give a better
understanding of the system.

The third section, the System Features, gives a full description of the actions
preformed by the system and gives details on the functions that are executed. All
the major services that will be provided by the product are documented here.

The fourth section, the External Interface Requirements, will give details on the
interaction between the user and the software through external interfaces. This
section will give a description on hardware and software interfaces that the Video
Searching software requires to perform an action.

Other requirements of the software will be described in the fifth section, Other
Nonfunctional Requirements. This will give the requirements for the software when
dealing with external entities and restrictions.

#### **1.3 Project Scope**


This Video Searching software will be a system that uses an active internet
connection to search multiple websites for streaming videos or torrents. The system
will be used to aid the user when trying to locate a specific video or genre of video.
It will help them reduce searching time through various different websites by
searching all these websites with just one query. It provides tools to help when
navigating through search results which will save time and effort.

The software aims to help the user by providing a simple interface and a more
efficient way of finding the video they require. It will also provide the user with


_**Software**_ _**Requirements Specification for x-ray**_ _**Page 2**_


various options and tools to help make their search more relevant to the content
that they need. The system will contain databases of the different websites that will
be used within the search. These databases can be easily updated to provide a
wider searching range.

#### **1.4 References**


Separate studies conducted by Damien C Holmes, William J Josephy, Alan
Woosnam, Mustapha A Sherrif, and Irshad A Qabool on video distribution within the
home. All studies based on private homes of the authors’ choosing, all studies
created on Feb 2009.

### **2. Overall Description**

#### **2.1 Product Perspective**


The program is a new self-contained product. It has come about due to the demand
for such a product being identified in a series of Ethnography studies. From these
studies we saw that the main activity people used video for was the watch content
found online. These people would regularly spend periods of time searching
websites to try and find the videos they wanted to watch, either somewhere to
stream the video from or the files to download the video. This was especially true of
the studies by Alan Woosnam, Irshad Qabool and Will Josephy. Our system will aim
to speed up this process.

#### **2.2 Product Features**


The main feature of the system will be a search engine for finding the location of
torrents and streaming sites for videos on the internet. The user can specify which
of the 2 or both to look for. The results will be divided into the types that were
specified using different tabs, and then the results will be orderable by different
categories, such as name, size, site, etc. The user will have the option to filter out
videos containing certain content depending on age restrictions, for example adult
content. In addition the user will have the option to filter out or only search certain
websites; for example a user may only want to look at videos on YouTube. They will
have the facility for users to store their favorite videos, so that they can come back
to the video at another time.

#### **2.3 User Classes and Characteristics**


There will be two levels of user for our system. The first will be the general user that
will be using our software to find their videos. They will only see the front end of the
system. The second level will be the system developers. They will be able to edit
which sites the system will search, depending on whether they think the site is safe,
compatible with our software, the speed at which the site can be searched, and how
useful the site is to us, i.e. how many results have come back from that site.

#### **2.4 Operating Environment**


The system will be portable; this means it will work across different operating
systems including Microsoft XP and Vista, Mac OS X and a range of Linux
platforms. Also it will work with different web browsers, for example Internet
Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.

The hardware needed for our system will be a reasonably up-to-date computer that
is connected to the internet via a modem.

### **3. System Features**

#### **3.1 Torrent Search**


**3.1.1 Description and Priority**


The user will give a search-term that will search through a database of compatible
torrent websites that are added by the development team. The results of this search
will be displayed as web links in a tab on the program’s main window. This is one of
the main features of the software and therefore has a high priority for development.


**3.1.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences**


User ticks torrent tick box – system will now query the torrent websites in its
database when a search is started.


User enters search term and starts search – system sends queries to the torrent
websites in its database based on the search term. Results for this query will then be
sent to the torrent tab in the program where they will display information such as
website, seeds, peers, size, date posted and a link for the webpage.


User sorts the search results by clicking once on a column header – system sorts all
results by descending/ascending order.


User clicks on next page button – system displays the next set of results for the
search.


**3.1.3 Functional Requirements**


REQ-1: Torrent search will share the same search bar with the streaming search.


REQ-2: Database of torrent sites can be updated via the internet.


REQ-3: There will be a tick box to allow the user to choose to include torrent
searching in the search.


REQ-4: Query will retrieve the no. of seed and peers, size of the file, date posted
and a link to the webpage itself.


REQ-5: If no results are found on a search it will display a message “No results were
found for this search.”


REQ-6: Results will be arranged in size/date/alphabetical order by clicking on the
column headers.


REQ-7: There will be page button for the user to navigate the results.


_**Software**_ _**Requirements Specification for x-ray**_ _**Page 5**_

#### **3.2 Video Stream Search**


**3.2.1 Description and Priority**


This feature will search a term the user enters, through a database of compatible
video streaming websites that are added by the development team. The video
websites will range from sites that actually host video such as MegaVideo,
YouTube, etc as well as websites that show links to videos hosted on other sites
such as surfthechannel.com, alluc.org, etc. The results will be displayed in a tab on
the programs main window. This tab will be split horizontally into two sections, the
top half for the video hosting sites and the bottom half for the video link sites. This is
another of the main features of the software and also has a higher priority for
development.


**3.2.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences**


User ticks streaming host tick box – system will now query the video hosting sites in
its database when a search is started. Hosting sites will include the actual videos on
their servers, e.g. YouTube.


User ticks streaming links tick box – system will now query the video link sites in its
database when a search is started. The link sites will include external video links to
different video hosting sites, e.g. surfthechannel.com.


User enters search term and starts search – system sends queries to the video
websites in its database based on the search term. Results for this query will then be
sent to the video stream tab in the program. The hosting half of the tab displays the
website, full video name, length and date posted. The link half of the tab displays the
website and video name (e.g. combination of the show’s name and the episode
name).


User sorts the search results by clicking once on the column header – system sorts
all results by descending/ascending order.


User filters websites they want to be shown in the results – system removes
unselected websites from the results.


User clicks on next page button – system displays the next set of results for the
search.


**3.2.3 Functional Requirements**


REQ-1: Streaming search will share the same search bar with the torrent search.


REQ-2: Database of video hosting and video linking sites can be updated via the
internet.


REQ-3: There will be a tick box to allow the user to choose to include video host
searching in the search.


_**Software**_ _**Requirements Specification for x-ray**_ _**Page 6**_


REQ-4: There will be a tick box to allow the user to choose to include video link
searching in the search.


REQ-5: Query to video hosting sites will retrieve full video name, length, date posted
and a link to the video itself.


REQ-6: Query to video link sites will retrieve the show’s name, episode name and a
link to the webpage itself.


REQ-7: If no results are found on a search it will display a message “No results were
found for this search.”


REQ-8: Results will be arranged in length/date/alphabetical order by clicking on the
column headers.


REQ-9: There will be page button for the user to navigate the results.

### **4. External Interface Requirements**

#### **4.1 User Interfaces**


The user Interface will consist of one main screen, allowing all the functionally to
come from this one screen. This allows the user to use the software with ease by
not flicking through a number of different screens. In addition to this the user can
always see the videos they are looking for. The main screen will be laid out as in
Appendix: B Diagram along with the description of the diagram. We decided on this
type of interface because we felt that it would be very simple for the user to
navigate. From our reports we found that the simpler the interface was, the more
people liked it.

With all these features complied into one screen it will give the software more
flexibility and allows for easy and simple usage. This will appeal to both naïve
computer users and experienced computer users with a higher selling market.

#### **4.2 Software Interfaces**


The software will use hyperlinks to allow the user to open websites in their default
web browser.

#### **4.3 Communications Interfaces**


Communication standards that will be used through the software will be PHP or
other such languages. These will be used to query the different servers that the
websites use and will give us back


_**Software**_ _**Requirements Specification for x-ray**_ _**Page 8**_

### **5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements**

#### **5.1 Performance Requirements**


REQ-1: Query times will take no longer than 5 seconds to any website.
REQ-2: Sending the hyperlink to the default browser will take less than 1 second.
REQ-3: Loading the program will take less than 10 seconds.
REQ-4: Any torrent result with 0 seeds will not be displayed. [1 ]
REQ-5: Sorting results should take less than 0.1 seconds.
REQ-6: A results page will display 100 results.
REQ-7: Any torrent result with a rating of less than 1 will not be displayed. [2 ]

1 – Any torrent with 0 seeds cannot guarantee to be fully downloaded.
2 – Any torrent with a rating of less than 1 should not be fully trusted; this was one
of the main complaints from users in William Josephys ethnographic study.

#### **5.2 Safety Requirements**


Our development team must thoroughly investigate each website within our
database each month, to ensure that no illegal or harmful content is exposed to our
users.

#### **5.3 Security Requirements**


We don’t maintain any user data or host any content.

#### **5.4 Legal Requirements**


While all safety measures resulting from the site may not be fully identified, a
recommendation of a full legal review of the software should be undertaken before
the site is available to the public. In doing so, the site will be subject to full
indemnification of liability.

The system we produce will stay within all the legal requirements on our behalf, as
our software is only listing links for video streams and video download, and this is
not illegal. Our system will not host any videos.

### Appendix A: Glossary


Terminology taken from Google:

Peer: A peer is one instance of a BitTorrent client running on a computer on the
Internet that you connect to and transfer data.

Seed: a complete copy of the file being made available for download.

Torrent: A Torrent in the Internet world is a site that uses BitTorrent technologies to
host file for P2P file download and sharing. A torrent contains the location of data
files that can be download from the BitTorrent peer-to-peer network. ...

1- The first feature of the software is a menu bar. This software includes the basic
features used in similar products such as new search, close, load etc. However with
our software there are two extra features. These being a filter option which allows the
user to set parental controls over the software. This enables the user to be able to
search for videos without getting explicit content. In addition to this there is a favorite’s
option. This feature gives the user the option of being able to store links to their favorite
videos in the software, and be able to go back to these websites after restarting the
software.

2- This is the main engine behind the software. This is where the user enters the name of
the video they wish to search for. Once the user has typed in the name of their desired
video they can either press the enter key or the search button to run the query.

3- These tick boxes tell the software to search for either torrents or streaming videos,
depending on what type of video the user wishes to view.

4- These are the tabs which bring up the different pages of the search results. This allows
the user to run multiple searches and keep different search results stored at the same
time.

5- This is where the actual search results will be displayed. Within these display fields the
user will be told the name of the video, the location of the video (which website the
video is on), the size of the video so the user can decide if they wish to download the
video or just to stream the video, the rating of the video with information on how safe
the website is, and finally comments on the video (what other user think of the video).
With this the user can then decide on how he wants the search results sorted using the
column headers at the top.
