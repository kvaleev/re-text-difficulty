## **2.0 General Description**

### **2.1 User Personas and Characteristics**


The target clients for our software are students in the sixth grade and their teacher. These
students are in the process of learning how to solve arithmetic problems involving fractions.
Moreover, these students (as well as the teacher) are assumed to have basic computer and
Internet skills that will enable them to use this software. The personas we will use to model our
intended users are:


  - Alice, a sixth grade female student learning fractions who does not like to use computers;

  - Bobby, a sixth grade male student learning fractions who is very competitive; and

CS373 The Denominators (10-2), SRS Version 2.0 Page 4 of 9


  - Claire, a sixth grade teacher with computer skills.


Detailed descriptions of these users follow.


**User A (Alice)**


Alice is a sixth grade female student learning fractions who does not like to use computers.
Although she has used computers for email and games, she considers computers to be boring.
She would rather read a story or talk with friends. However, she is really interested in learning
fractions and enjoys working with other students.


**User B (Bobby)**


Bobby is a sixth grade male student learning fractions who is very competitive. He enjoys
playing competitive sports and using computers, especially to play games. He has used
computers since age five. He particularly likes to play games where he can excel. He is only
somewhat interested in learning about fractions.


**User C (Claire)**


Claire is a sixth grade teacher who has computer skills. She enjoys teaching sixth graders and
is interested in finding innovative ways to teach her students. She has been teaching the sixth
grade for six years now. She finds that students have a particularly hard time learning about
the concepts related to fractions.

### **2.2 Product Perspective**




- This program requires a web browser capable of running Flash movies.




- This program will not be dependent on any other software and is not a component of
another program.




- Since the product requires a Flash-supporting browser, the external interface will depend
on the configuration of the browser. Therefore, various environments may yield different
interfaces, but the behavior of the program will be the same.




  - This program does not require any new hardware.

### **2.3 Overview of Functional Requirements**


The umbrella will be a singular component, providing links to projects relating to fractions,
decimals, and percents in a format accessible over the World Wide Web.


The "Space Fractions" game will have the following functional components:


1. An introductory movie to set up the storyline.
2. A main menu, including a brief help section.
3. A series of fraction questions (testing arithmetic, equivalence, graphical interpretation,
and improper versus proper fraction skills) that sequentially form a storyline related to the
introduction.
4. An ending scene where the user's score is calculated and ranked, with an option to quit
the game or try again.


http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/s2s/latest/fractions4/doc/SRS.html 1/22/2003


CS373 The Denominators (10-2), SRS Version 2.0 Page 5 of 9


In addition, a component accessible over the World Wide Web will allow the series of fraction
questions to be updated by an administrator of the game.

### **2.4 Overview of Data Requirements**


The administrator of the program may wish to design a custom game complete with custom
fraction questions. This information must be saved in a file on the web server where the game
is hosted and will be easily edited through simplified administrative screens. The user's score
must be kept as local data within the game so that the results may be given at the end of the
game. Input will consist entirely of mouse clicks for the user to choose answer options and to
set preferences. Output will be sounds and animations through Flash movies to acknowledge
success or failure in answering the fraction questions.

### **2.5 General Constraints, Assumptions, Dependencies, and Guidelines**


This program will run on any Internet-accessible computer with a web browser that supports
JavaScript and Macromedia Flash 5.

### **2.6 User View of Product Use**


Upon starting the program, the user is taken through a brief introductory movie to provide
background story and information that will help them complete the fraction questions. There is
an option to skip the introduction, if desired. Otherwise, they will watch the movie to its
completion and be taken to the main screen.


At the main title screen, the user will be able to view a general help screen to reveal basic
instructions on game play. Also, a short summary of our team and a link to our website will be
provided. To start the game, the user will click on the corresponding button. The information
and interface will be effective so that Bobby will easily recognize what to do to start the game
immediately and Alice will have no problems navigating through the help section to understand
the rules and gameplay. Claire will be assured that the students will know what to do from this
main screen.


Next, the user progresses through a series of questions in the form of cartoon images that
comprise the main story. These questions will test the user's knowledge of basic fraction
operations and will be presented as a multiple-choice questionnaire. The user will be given a
problem and then must click the correct solution. A friendly robotic sidekick will assist with
general usability issues and give hints towards the correct response. Bobby will be captivated
by the storyline and will wish to progress as fast as possible. The gameplay will be dynamic
and adaptive to provide different storylines based on the user's progress.


After the last question, the main character's adventure will come to an end. The last scene will
be determined by the user's response on certain critical questions that impact the story's plot,
and an option to try again will be presented. In addition, the player's exact score will be given
with a customized message. This gives Bobby the competition he requires and allows Alice to
have a unique experience the next time through the program. Either way, the user will be
encouraged to try again and further better their fraction skills.


As the game administrator, Claire can use the question updater to change any of the questions

in the game. She navigates to the updater page, which asks for a password. Upon correct
submission of her password, she uses an intuitive web forms interface to update the game to
her desiring.

game: there will be a small introductory movie (~200KB), a main menu movie (~100KB), and a
main game movie (1-2MB). Due to the relatively small size of the introductory and main menu
movies, they can be downloaded in approximately one minute with a modem connection.
Because Flash movies do not have to be fully downloaded to play, the main game can be
played within a few minutes with a regular modem connection to the Internet.

### **3.4 Quality Attributes**


  - The product will be as secure as the web browser that will run the product.

  - The product will be available over the Internet via the S2S website.

  - Reliability will be ensured by extensive testing by the team members and mentors, if
available.

  - Maintainability is a primary goal for this project. For example, using appropriate subscenes in the main Flash game to split up the code will allow for easy alteration at a later
date.

### **3.5 Other Requirements**


There are no additional requirements at this time.
