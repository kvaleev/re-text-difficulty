### **Abstract**

**This document describes a proposal for a standard C/C++ modeling interface for**
**emulators and other verification platforms. The interface provides multiple**
**communication channels between software models running on a host workstation and a**
**device under test (DUT) represented as a structural hardware netlist running on a**
**verification platform such as an emulator. The channel end points are presented as**
**message ports to the DUT model and as message port proxies to the software models.**

# SCE-API Version 1.0 Revision 1.9


**1 of 94**


**Introduction**

## **1.0 Introduction**


**1.1 Purpose**

There is an urgent need for the EDA industry to meet the exploding verification requirements of SoC
design teams. While the industry has delivered verification performance in the form of a variety of
emulation and rapid prototyping platforms, there remains the problem of connecting them into SoC
modeling environments while realizing their full performance potential. Existing standard verification
interfaces were designed to meet the needs of design teams of over 10 years ago. A new type of
interface is needed to meet the verification challenges of the next 10 years. This document is a proposal
for a multichannel communication interface that addresses these challenges. This new interface must
cater to the needs of both emulation end users and emulation suppliers.


**1.1.1** **Emulation Customer Problems to be Solved by SCE-API**

**`•`** All emulators on the market today have proprietary APIs. The proliferation of APIs makes it very
difficult for software-based verification products to port to the different emulators, thus restricting
the solutions available to customers. This also leads to low productivity and low return on
investment (ROI) for emulator customers who build their own solutions.

**`•`** The emulation “APIs” which exist today are oriented to gate-level and not system-level
verification.

**`•`** The industry needs an API which takes full advantage of emulation performance.


**1.1.2** **Emulation Suppliers Problems to be Solved**

**`•`** Customers are reluctant to invest in building applications on proprietary APIs.

**`•`** Traditional simulator APIs like programmable language interface (PLI) and VHDL PLI slow down
emulators.

**`•`** Third parties are reluctant to invest in building applications on proprietary APIs.


**1.2 Scope**

This document is directed to members of the _Standard Co-Emulation API_ (SCE-API) technical
committee. The committee members represent a consortium of EDA customers and EDA tool suppliers
dedicated to the creation of a breakthrough high-performance common emulation API. The founding
participants in the consortium are Aptix, CoWare, Ikos Systems, Mentor Graphics, ST Microelectronics,
Synopsys, and TransEDA.


The scope of this document shall be restricted to what is specifically referred to herein as the _Standard_
_Co-Emulation API: Modeling Interface_ (SCE-MI). This modeling interface is intended to be one of
possibly several parts making up the whole SCE-API standard. In the future, SCE-API may be
expanded to include additional parts to handle such features as debug and control, code coverage, etc.


This document is intended to describe an overall use model of the SCE-MI, a tutorial illustrating this
use model, and a formal functional specification of the SCE-MI API itself. Future revisions of the
document will continue to reflect the feedback from members of the SCE-API technical committee. It is
hoped that the document will undergo a relatively quick evolution phase which culminates with a
common industry standard that can be used by simulation and emulation tool vendors to provide plugand-play high speed verification solutions to end users on SoC design teams.

**1.6 Overview**

This specification describes a modeling interface that provides multiple channels of communication that
allow software models describing system behavior to connect to structural models describing
implementation of a device under test (DUT). Each communication channel is designed to transport
untimed _messages_ of arbitrary abstraction between its two end points or “ports” of a channel.


These message channels are not meant to connect software models to each other but rather to connect
software proxy models to message port interfaces on the hardware side of the design. The means to
interconnect software models to each other must be provided by a software modeling and simulation
environment such as SystemC which is beyond the scope of this document.


Although the _software side_ of a system can be modeled at several different levels of abstraction
including untimed, cycle accurate, and even gate level, the focus of the SCE-MI is to interface purely
untimed software models with an RTL or gate level DUT. This can be summarized with the following
recommendations regarding the API:

**`•`** Do not use it to bridge event based or sub-cycle accurate simulation environments

**`•`** It is possible but not ideal to bridge cycle accurate simulation environments

**`•`** It is ideal for bridging an untimed simulation environment with a cycle accurate simulation
environment


There are many references in the document to SystemC as the modeling environment for untimed
software models. This is because, although SystemC is capable of modeling at the cycle accurate RTL
abstraction level, it is also considered ideally suited for untimed modeling. As such, it has been chosen
for use in many of the examples in this document.

**Introduction**


**1.6.1** **Performance Goals**
While the _software_ _side_ of the described interface is generic in its ability to be used in any C/C++
modeling environment, it is optimized to be compatible with SystemC (see reference [1]). Similarly, its
_hardware_ _side_ is optimized to prevent undue throttling of an emulator during a co-modeling session run.


Throughout this document the term _emulation_ or _emulator_ is used to denote a structural or RTL model
of a DUT running in an emulator, rapid prototype, or other simulation environment including software
HDL simulators.


That said however, the focus of the design of this interface is to avoid communication bottlenecks that
might become most apparent when interfacing software models to an emulator as compared to
interfacing them to a slower software HDL simulator or even an HDL accelerator. Such bottlenecks
could severely compromise the performance of an emulator which is otherwise very fast. Although
some implementations of the interface can be more inefficient than others, there should be nothing in
the specification of the interface itself that renders it inherently susceptible to such bottlenecks.


For this reason, the communication channels described herein are _message_ or _transaction_ oriented
rather than _event_ oriented with the idea that a single message over a channel originating from a software
model can trigger dozens to hundreds of clocked events in the hardware side of the channel. Similarly, it
can take thousands of clocked events on the hardware side to generate the content of a message on a
channel originating from the hardware that is ultimately destined for an untimed software model.


**1.6.2** **Document Layout**
The document is divided into the following three major chapters:

**`•`** Chapter 2.0: An overall description and use model for the SCE Modeling Interface (SCE-MI).

**`•`** Chapter 3.0: A tutorial that shows how the use model is used in a simple application.

**`•`** Chapter 4.0: A formal functional specification of the API itself.


**1.6.3** **Document Conventions**

**`•`** Any references to actual literal names that might be found in source code, identifiers that are part of
the API, file names, and other literal names are represented in `courier` font.

**`•`** Key concepts words, or phrases are often _italicized_ . Also, there is a good chance that any _italicized_
text may have a definition in the glossary, so the reader is directed there for a more detailed
meaning of a term.

The SCE-MI provides a transport infrastructure between the emulator and host workstation sides of
each channel, that interconnects _transactor_ models in the emulator to C (untimed or RTL) models on the
workstation. Again it is important to note that for purposes of this document, the term emulator can be
used interchangeably with any simulator capable of executing RTL or gate-level models, including
software HDL simulators. These interconnects are provided in the form of message channels that run
between the _software side_ and the _hardware side_ of the SCE-MI infrastructure. Each message channel
has two ends. The end on the software side is called a _message port proxy_ which is a C++ object that
gives API access to the channel. The end on the hardware side is a _message port_ macro that is
instantiated inside a transactor and connected to other components in the transactor. Each message
channel is either an input or an output channel with respect to the hardware side.


It is important to note that message channels are not unidirectional or bidirectional busses in the sense
of hardware signals, but are rather more like network sockets that use message passing protocols. It is
the job of the transactors to serve as _abstraction gaskets_ that decompose messages arriving on input
channels from the software side into sequences of cycle accurate events that are to be clocked into the
DUT. For the other direction of flow, transactors recompose sequences of events coming from the DUT
back into messages to be sent via output channels to the software side.


**6 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Overall Description and Use Model**


In addition, the SCE-MI infrastructure provides clock (and reset) generation and shared clock control
using handshake signals with the transactor. This allows the transactor to “freeze” _controlled time_ while
performing message composition and decomposition operations.


**2.1.1** **Support for Multi-Threaded Environments**
The SCE-MI is designed to couple easily with multi-threaded environments such as SystemC, yet it also
functions just as easily in single-threaded environments such as simple C programs. A special _service_
_loop_ function (see section 4.3.3.6 on page 68) is provided by the SCE-MI that can be called from an
application to give the SCE-MI infrastructure an opportunity to service its communication channels. It
is inside this function that queued up input messages can be sent to the hardware side and arriving
output messages can be dispatched to the appropriate software models.


While there is no thread specific code inside the service loop function or elsewhere in the SCE-MI, in a
multi-threaded environment this function is designed to be called periodically from a dedicated thread
so that the interface is automatically serviced while other threads are running.


In a single-threaded environment, the service loop function can be “sprinkled” throughout the
application code at strategically placed points to allow it to frequently yield CPU cycles to the SCE-MI
infrastructure so that it can service its messages channels.


**2.2 Users of the Interface**

A major goal of this specification is to address the needs of three target audiences, each with a distinct
interest in their use of the interface. The target audiences are as follows:

**`•`** End user

**`•`** Transactor implementor

**`•`** SCE-MI infrastructure implementor


**2.2.1** **End User**
The _end user_ is interested in quickly and easily establishing a bridge between a software testbench that
can be composed of high level, _untimed_, algorithmic software models, and a hardware DU that can be
modeled at the RTL, cycle accurate level of abstraction.


While end users might be aware of the need for a “gasket” that bridges these two levels of abstraction,
they want the creation of these _abstraction bridges_ to be as painless and automated as possible. Ideally,
the end users are not required to be familiar with the details of SCE-MI API.


Rather, on the _hardware side_, they might wish to rely on the _transactor implementor_ (see next section)
to provide predefined _transactor_ models that can directly interface to their DUT. This would remove
any requirement for them to be familiar with any of the SCE-MI hardware-side interface macros (see
section 4.1 on page 46) except possibly the `SceMiClockPort` macro whose interface is easy to
understand because all it really does is furnish a clock and a reset.


Similarly, on the _software side_, the end users can also rely on the transactor implementors to furnish
them with _plug-and-play_ software models, custom tailored for a software modeling environment such
as SystemC. Such models would encapsulate the details of interfacing to the SCE-MI software side and,
might present a fully _untimed_, easy to use interface to the rest of the software testbench.


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **7 of 94**


**Overall Description and Use Model**


**2.2.2** **Transactor Implementor**
The transactor implementor is familiar with the interface presented by the SCE-MI but is not concerned
with its implementation.


The job of the transactor implementor is to provide plug-and-play transactor models on the _hardware_
_side_ and proxy models on the _software side_ that might be used by _end users_ to easily bridge their
untimed software models with their RTL-represented DUT. Additionally, the transactor implementor
can supply _proxy models_ on the software side that provide untimed “sockets” to the transactors.


Using the models is like using any other vendor supplied, stand-alone IP models and the details of
bridging not only two different abstraction levels but possibly two different verification platforms (such
as SystemC and an emulator), is completely hidden within the implementations of the models. They
must be distributed with appropriate object code, netlists, RTL code, configuration files, and all
necessary documentation.


**2.2.3** **SCE-MI Infrastructure Implementor**
The SCE-MI infrastructure implementor is interested in furnishing a working implementation of an
SCE-MI that runs on some vendor supplied verification platform (probably their own). Any distributed
product release from the infrastructure implementor will necessarily include both the _software side_ and
the _hardware side_ components of the SCE-MI. For such a release to be complaint, it must conform to all
the requirements set forth in this specification.


**2.3 Bridging Levels of Modeling Abstraction**

The central goal of this specification is to provide an interface designed to bridge two modeling
environments, each of which supports a different level of modeling abstraction.


**2.3.1** **Untimed Software Level Modeling Abstraction**
Suppose we have a testbench consisting of several, possibly independent models that stimulate and
respond to a DUT at different interface points. Figure 2 depicts such a system. Such a configuration can
be used to test a processor DUT that has some communications interfaces that can include an ethernet
adapter, PCI interface, and a USB interface. The testbench can consist of several models that
independently interact with these interfaces, playing their protocols and exchanging packets with them.
These packets might be recoded as _messages_ with the intent of verifying the processor DUT’s ability to
deal with them. The system in Figure 2 might initially be implemented fully at the _untimed_ level of
abstraction using the SystemC software modeling environment.


**8 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Overall Description and Use Model**


**FIGURE 2.** Untimed Software Testbench and DUT Models


**Untimed** **Untimed**
**Testbench (TB) Models** **DUT Model**


Now suppose that we ultimately want to create cycle accurate RTL models of the DUT model and eventually
synthesize it to gates that can be verified on a high speed emulation platform. Once we do this however, we
might still want to test them with the unaltered, untimed testbench models. Doing so requires a way of
somehow bridging the untimed level of abstraction to the _bus cycle accurate_ ( _BCA)_ level.


**2.3.2** **Cycle Accurate Hardware Level Modeling Abstraction**
Suppose now that we take the purely untimed system shown in Figure 2, “pry apart” the direct coupling
between the testbench models and the untimed DUT model, and insert an _abstraction bridge_ in order to
bridge the still untimed system testbench model to what is now a emulator resident, RTL-represented DUT.
Figure 3 depicts this new configuration.


This bridge consists of a set of _DUT proxy_ models, SCE-MI _message input and output port proxies_, a set of
_message channels_ which are transaction conduits between the software simulator and the emulator, _message_
_input and output ports_, and a set of user implemented _transactors_ .


The SCE-MI infrastructure performs the task of serving as a transport layer that guarantees delivery of
_messages_ back and forth between the _message port proxy_ and _message port_ ends of each channel. Messages
arriving on input channels are presented to the transactors through _message input ports_ . Similarly, messages


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **9 of 94**


**Overall Description and Use Model**


arriving on output channels are dispatched to the _DUT proxy_ software models via _message output port_
_proxies_ that present them to the rest of the testbench as if they had come directly from original untimed
DUT model as depicted in Figure 2. In fact, the testbench models do not know that the messages have
actually come from and gone to a totally different abstraction level.


The DUT input proxies have the job of accepting untimed messages from various C models and sending
them to the message input port proxies for transport to the hardware side. The DUT output proxies
establish callbacks that monitor the message output port proxies for arrival of messages from the
hardware side. In other words, the SCE-MI infrastructure _dispatches_ these messages to the specific
DUT proxy models to which they are addressed.


Taking this discussion back to the context of users of the interface described in section 2.2 on page 7,
the _end user_ only has to know how to interface with the DUT proxy models on the software side of
Figure 3 with the transactor models on the hardware side; whereas, the _transactor implementor_ authors
the proxy and transactor models using the SCE-MI message port and clock control components between
them, and provides those models to the end user.

**2.3.3** **Messages and Transactions**
At this point, it makes sense to describe in more detail what a _message_ is and how it is used in an
untimed software modeling environment. In the discussion above, the implied meaning of a message is
that it is a unit of data of arbitrary size and abstraction to be transported over a channel.


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **11 of 94**


**Overall Description and Use Model**


In a purely untimed modeling environment, messages are not associated with specific clocks or events.
Rather, they can be considered arbitrary data types ranging in abstraction from a simple bit, boolean or
integer, on up to something as complex as a C++ class or even some aggregate of objects.


It is in this form that messages can be transported either _by value_ or _by reference_ over abstract ports
between fully untimed software models of the sort described in Figure 2 and, in substantially more
detail in reference [1].


However, before messages can be transported over an SCE-MI message channel, their content must be
serialized into a large bit vector by the DUT proxy model. Conversely, after a message arrives on a
message output channel and is dispatched to a DUT output proxy model, it might be _de-serialized_ back
into an abstract C++ data type. At this point, it is ready for presentation at the abstract output ports (to
use SystemC terminology) of the DUT proxy to the connected software testbench models.


Meanwhile, on the hardware side, a message arriving on the message input channel can trigger many
dozens to hundreds of clocks of event activity. It is the job of the transactor to perform this
decomposition of message data content to sequences of clocked events that are presented to the DUT
hardware model inputs. Conversely, for output messages, it might be the job of the transactor to accept
possibly hundreds to thousands of clocked events originating from the DUT hardware model, and
assemble them into serialized bit streams that are sent back to the software side for de-serialization back
into abstract data types.


Note that, for the most part, the term _message_ can be used interchangeably with _transaction._ However,
in some contexts, _transaction_ can be thought of as including infrastructure overhead content in addition
to user payload data (and handled at a lower layer of the interface) whereas, the term _message_ denotes
only user payload data.


**2.3.4** **Controlled and Uncontrolled Time**
One of the implications of the transactor’s job of converting between message bit streams and clocked
events is that it might need the ability to “freeze” controlled time while performing these operations
such that the _controlled clock_ that feeds the DUT is stopped long enough for the operations to occur.


If one visualizes the transactor operations strictly in terms of controlled clock cycles, they appear
between edges of the controlled clock. This is depicted in the controlled time view shown in Figure 4.
But if they are shown for all cycles of the _uncontrolled clock_, the waveforms would appear more like the
_uncontrolled time_ view shown in Figure 4. In this view, the controlled clock is suspended or disabled
and the DUT is “frozen in controlled time.”


Suppose a system has multiple controlled clocks (of possibly differing frequencies) and multiple
transactors controlling them. Any one of these transactors has the option of stopping any clock. If this
happens, all controlled clocks in the system stop in unison. Furthermore, all other transactors that did
not themselves stop the clock, must still sense that the clocks were globally stopped and continue to
function correctly even though they themselves had no need to stop the clock. In this case, they might
typically idle for the number of uclocks during which the cclocks are stopped as illustrated in Figure 4.

In the SCE-MI use model, the semantics of clock control can be described as follows:

**`•`** Any transactor can instruct the SCE-MI infrastructure to stop the controlled clock and thus cause
controlled time to freeze.

**`•`** All transactors are told by the SCE-MI infrastructure when the controlled clock is stopped.

**`•`** Any transactor must function correctly if controlled time is stopped due to operations of another
transactor, even if the transactor in question does not itself need to stop the clock.

**`•`** A transactor might need to stop the controlled clock when performing operations that involve
decomposition or composition of transactions arriving from, or going to a message channel.

**`•`** The DUT is always clocked by one or more controlled clocks that are controlled by one or more
transactors.

**`•`** All transactors are clocked by a free running uncontrolled clock that is provided by the SCE-MI
hardware side infrastructure.

**Overall Description and Use Model**


**2.4 Work Flow**

There are four major aspects of work flow involved in constructing a system verification with the SCEMI environment. They are as follows:

**`•`** Software model compilation

**`•`** Infrastructure linkage

**`•`** Hardware model elaboration

**`•`** Software model construction and binding


**2.4.1** **Software Model Compilation**
The models to be run on the workstation are compiled using a common C/C++ compiler or possibly
obtained from other sources such as third party vendors in the form of IP, ISS simulators, etc. The
compiled models are linked with the software side of the SCE-MI infrastructure to form an executable
program.


**2.4.2** **Infrastructure Linkage**
Infrastructure linkage is the process that reads a user description of the hardware, namely the source or
_bridge_ netlist that describes the interconnect between the transactors, the DUT, and the SCE-MI
interface components, and compiles that netlist into a form suitable for emulation. Part of this compile
process can involve adding additional structure to the bridge netlist, that properly interfaces the user
supplied netlist to the SCE-MI infrastructure implementation components. Put more simply, the
infrastructure linker is responsible for providing the core of the SCE-MI interface macros on the
hardware side.


As part of this process, the infrastructure linker also looks at the parameters specified on the instantiated
interface macros in the user-supplied bridge netlist and uses them to properly establish the dimensions
of the interface. Among the parameters it analyzes are the following:

**`•`** Number of transactors

**`•`** Number of input and output channels

**`•`** Width of each channel

**`•`** Number of clocks

**`•`** Clock ratios

**`•`** Clock duty cycles


Once the final netlist is created, the infrastructure linker can then appropriately compile it for the
emulation platform and accordingly convert it to a form suitable to run on the emulator.


**2.4.3** **Hardware Model Elaboration**
The compiled netlist is downloaded to the emulator, elaborated, and prepared for binding to the
software.


**2.4.4** **Software Model Construction and Binding**
The software executable compiled and linked in the software compilation phase is now executed which
causes all the software models to be constructed in the workstation process image space. Once
construction takes place, the software models bind themselves to the message port proxies using special
calls provided in the API. Parameters passed to these calls establish a means by which specific message

**Overall Description and Use Model**


port proxies can _rendezvous_ with its associated message port macro in the hardware. Once this binding
occurs, the co-modeling session can proceed.


**2.5 SCE-MI Interface Components**

The SCE-MI run time environment consists of a set of interface components on both the _hardware side_
and the _software side_ of the interface, each of which provides a distinct level of functionality.  They are
introduced in this section, and each is discussed in more detail later in this document.


**2.5.1** **Hardware Side Interface Components**
The interface components presented by the SCE-MI _hardware side_ consist of a small set of macros that
provide connection points between the transactors and the SCE-MI infrastructure. These compactly
defined and simple to use macros fully present all necessary aspects of the interface to the transactors
and the DUT.


From the point of view of this specification, these macros are simply represented as empty Verilog or
VHDL models with clearly defined port and parameter interfaces. This is analogous to a software API
specification that defines function prototypes of the API calls without showing their implementations.
Future implementations of the interface can also accommodate modeling hardware in RTL C (a.k.a.
RTC) using a C modeling language like SystemC, rather than RTL Verilog or VHDL. Such
implementations would need to provide the RTC equivalents of the same macros defined in this
specification.


Briefly stated, the four macros present the following interfaces to the transactors and DUT:

**`•`** Message input port interface

**`•`** Message output port interface

**`•`** Controlled clock and controlled reset generator interface

**`•`** Uncontrolled clock, uncontrolled reset, clock control logic interfaces


**2.5.2** **Software Side Interface Components**
The interface presented by SCE-MI infrastructure to the software side consists of a set of C++ objects
and methods which provide the following functionality:

**`•`** Version discovery

**`•`** Parameter access

**`•`** Initialization and shutdown

**`•`** Message input and output port proxy binding and callback registration

**`•`** Rendezvous operations with the hardware side

**`•`** Infrastructure service loop polling function

**`•`** Message input send function

**`•`** Message output receive callback dispatching

**`•`** Message input ready callback dispatching

**`•`** Error handling


In addition to the C++ object oriented interface, a set of C API functions is also provided for the benefit
of pure C applications.

## **3.0 User’s Guide and Tutorial**


**3.1 Hardware Side Interfacing**

The hardware side interface of the SCE-MI consists of a set of parametrized macros which can be
instantiated inside transactors that are to interact which the SCE-MI infrastructure. The macros are
parametrized such that, at the point of instantiation, crucial parameters that will dictate the dimensions
of the SCE-MI bridge to software can be easily specified by the user. It is the job of the _infrastructure_
_linker_ to learn the values of these parameters and customize implementation components inserted
underneath the macros accordingly.


The following four macros fully characterize how the hardware side interface of the SCE-MI is
presented to the transactors and the DUT:

**`•`** `SceMiMessageInPort` macro

**`•`** `SceMiMessageOutPort` macro

**`•`** `SceMiClockControl` macro

**`•`** `SceMiClockPort` macro


Any number of these macros can be instantiated as is required by the system. One `SceMiMessageInPort`
macro must be instantiated for each required message input channel, and one `SceMiMessageOutPort`
macro for each output channel. Message port macro bit-widths are parametrized at the point of
instantiation.


Exactly one `SceMiClockPort` macro is instantiated for each defined clock in the system. This

`SceMiClockPort` macro instance will, via a set of parameters, fully characterize a particular clock. The

`SceMiClockPort` macro is instantiated at the top level and provides a controlled clock and reset directly
to the DUT. The `SceMiClockPort` macro instance is named and assigned a reference `ClockNum`
parameter that is used to associate it with one or more counterpart `SceMiClockControl` macros inside
one or more transactors. The `SceMiClockControl` macro is used by its transactor for all clock
controlling operations for its associated clock. These two macros are mutually associated by the

`ClockNum` parameter and every `SceMiClockPort` macro must have a minimum of one

`SceMiClockControl` macro associated with it.


The infrastructure linker (not the user) is responsible for properly hooking up these, essentially empty,
macro instances to the internally generated SCE-MI infrastructure and clock generation circuitry.


The following parameters specified at the points of instantiation of the macros fully specify the required
dimensions of the SCE-MI infrastructure components (see 4.2.1 on page 59 for more details):

**`•`** Number of transactors

**`•`** Number of input and output channels

**`•`** Name and width of each channel

**`•`** Number of controlled clocks

**`•`** Name, clock ratio, and duty cycle of each controlled clock


Figure 5 shows a simple example of how a transactor and DUT might connect to the hardware side
interface of the SCE-MI.


**16 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**User’s Guide and Tutorial**


**FIGURE 5.** Connection of SCE-MI Macros on Hardware Side to Transactor and DUT

u1





















This example features a single transactor interacting with a DUT and interfacing to the software side
through a `SceMiMessageInPort` and a `SceMiMessageOutPort` . In addition, it defines a single clock that
is controlled by the transactor internally using the `SceMiClockControl` macro. This clock drives the
DUT from the top level through a `SceMiClockPort` macro.


A key point that this example illustrates is that only the _transactor implementor_ (see 2.2 on page 7)
needs to be aware of all SCE-MI interface macros (except for the `SceMiClockPort` ). Because the
transactor encapsulates the message port macros and the `SceMiClockControl` macro, the _end user_ only
has to be aware of how to hook up to the transactor itself and to the `SceMiClockPort` macro.


The `SceMiClockPort` macro instantiation is where all the clock parameters are specified. The numbers
shown (see Figure 5) in the component instantiation label as,

```
  #(1, 1, 1, 50, 50, 0, 8) cclock

```

map to the parameters defined for the `SceMiClockPort` macro (see 4.1.4 on page 51). They are
summarized here:

**`•`** `ClockNum` = 1

**`•`** `RatioNumerator` = 1

**`•`** `RatioDenominator` = 1


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **17 of 94**


**User’s Guide and Tutorial**


**`•`** `DutyHi` = 50

**`•`** `DutyLo` = 50

**`•`** `Phase` = 0

**`•`** `ResetCycles` = 8


Of these parameters, the `ClockNum` parameter is used to uniquely identify this particular clock and also
to associate it with its 1 or more counterpart `SceMiClockControl` macros which must be parametrized to
the same `ClockNum` value, in this case 1. In addition to learning the clock specification parameters, the
_infrastructure linker_ also learns the name of each clock by looking at the instance label of each

`SceMiClockPort` instance, in this case `cclock` .


Similarly, message ports have a parametrized `PortWidth` parameter.


To summarize, the _infrastructure linker_ learns the following specific information from analyzing this
netlist:

**`•`** Single transactor called “Bridge.u1” (assuming top level module is called “Bridge”).

**`•`** Single “divide-by-1” controlled clock called “cclock”

**`•`** Controlled clock has a 1/1 ratio which, when enabled, is ideally (depending on implementation) the
same frequency as the uncontrolled clock

**`•`** Controlled clock is parametrized to 50/50 duty cycle with 0 phase shift (a user can also specify a
_don’t care duty cycle_               - see 4.1.4.1 on page 52 for details)

**`•`** Controlled reset is parametrized to 8 controlled clock cycles of reset

**`•`** Single `SceMiMessageInPort` called “p1”, parametrized to bit-with of 64

**`•`** Single `SceMiMessageOutPort` called “p2” parametrized to bit-width of 128


A more complicated example that involves two transactors and three clocks is shown in Appendix B: on
page 90.


**3.2 The** **`Routed`** **Tutorial**

The `Routed` tutorial documents a real life example that uses the SCE-MI to interface between untimed
software models modeled in SystemC, and hardware models of transactors and a DUT modeled in RTL
Verilog. This tutorial tries to illustrate how the use model of the SCE-MI can be applied in a multithreaded SystemC environment. It assumes some familiarity with the concepts of SystemC including
_abstract ports_, _autonomous threads_, _slave threads_, module and port definition, and module instantiation
and interconnect. Reference [1] has a description of these concepts.


**3.2.1** **What the Design Does**
The `Routed` design is a small design that simulates air passengers traveling from `Origin` s to

`Destination` s by traversing various interconnected `Pipe` s and `Hub` s in a `RouteMap` . In this design, the

`Origin` s and `Destination` s are the _transactors_ and the `RouteMap` model is the _DUT_ . Each `Origin`
transactor interfaces to a `SceMiMessageInPort` to gain access to messages arriving from the software
side. Each `Destination` transactor interfaces to a `SceMiMessageOutPort` to send messages to the
software side. There is also an `OrigDest` module that has both an `Origin` and `Destination` transactor
contained within it.


**18 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**User’s Guide and Tutorial**


The “world” consists of these `Origin` s,

```
  Anchorage, Cupertino, Noida, SealBeach, UK, Waltham,

```

and these `Destination` s,

```
  Anchorage, Cupertino, Maui, SealBeach, UK.

```

Travel from any `Origin` to any `Destination` is possible by traversing the `RouteMap` (DUT) containing
the following `Pipe` interconnected `Hub` s,

```
  Chicago, Dallas, Newark, SanFran, Seattle.

```

Each controlled clock cycle represents one hour of travel or layover time.


Figure 6 shows how the `Routed` world is interconnected.

The numbers shown by the directed arcs are the travel time (in hours) to travel the indicated `Pipe` .
Layover time in each `Hub` is two hours.


The `RouteMap` is initialized by injecting `TeachRoute` messages for the entire system through the

`Waltham Origin` transactor. Each `TeachRoute` message contains a piece of routing information


**20 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**User’s Guide and Tutorial**


addressed to a particular `Hub` to load the route into its `RouteTable` module (see Figure 9 on page 25).
Using this simple mechanism, the software side `RouteConfig` model progressively teaches each `Hub` its
routes (via `Waltham` ) so that it can, in turn, pass additional `TeachRoute` tokens to `Hub` s more distant from

`Waltham` . In other words, by first teaching closer hubs, the RouteMap learns to pass routes bound for
more distant hubs. This process continues until the entire mesh is initialized, at which point it is ready to
serve as a backbone for all air travel activity.


After initiating the route configuration, the testbench then executes the itineraries of 4 passengers over a
period of 22 days. Each itinerary consists of several legs, each with scheduled departure from a
specified `Origin` and each with a specified `Destination` . The scheduled leg is sent as a message token
to its designated `Origin` transactor. It is the job of the transactor to count the number of clocks until the
specified departure time before sending the token into the `RouteMap` mesh.


**3.2.2** **System Hierarchy**
The hierarchy of the whole system is textually shown in the following subsections.


**3.2.2.1** **Software Side Hierarchy**

                  SceMiClockControl

```

Notice that at the `Bridge` level only the `SceMiClockPort` macro, _transactor_ components, and the DUT
appear. Encapsulated within the `Origin` and `Destination` transactors are the `SceMiMessageInPort`,

`SceMiMessageOutPort`, and `SceMiClockControl` macros. The `ClockAdvancer` transactor has both
message input and output ports in addition to the required `SceMiClockControl` macro.


**3.2.3** **Hardware Side**


**3.2.3.1** **Bridge**
The bridge between the hardware and software side of the design is depicted in Figure 7. Notice that this
diagram more or less follows the structure of the generalized _abstraction bridge_ shown in Figure 3 on
page 11. The design uses 13 message channels in all. Two (message input and output) for the `Calendar`

`<-> ClockAdvancer` connection, six message input channels for the `Scheduler <-> Origin`
connections, and five output channels for the `Scheduler <-> Destination` connections.

The two software models that interact with the hardware side are the `Calendar` model and the

`Scheduler` model. These models encapsulate message port proxies which give them direct access to the
message channels leading to the `Origin` and `Destination` transactors on the hardware side. These two
software models are the only ones that are aware of the SCE-MI link. They converse with the other
models through SystemC abstract ports.


On the hardware side, there is a set of `Origin` and `Destination` transactors that service the message
channels that interface with the `Scheduler` and route tokens to or from the DUT. Some locations, such
as `Anchorage` and the `UK`, are both `Origin` and `Destination` (called `OrigDest` ).


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **23 of 94**


**User’s Guide and Tutorial**


In addition, there is a `ClockAdvancer` transactor that interfaces directly with the `Calendar` model. The

`ClockAdvancer` is a stand-alone transactor that does not converse with the DUT. Its only job is to allow
time to advance a day at a time (see section 3.2.3.5 on page 28 for more details).


**3.2.3.2** **DUT and Transactor Interconnect**

`Pipe` s are inserted between two `Hub` s or between an `Origin` or `Destination` transactor and a `Hub` .
Longer `Pipe` s can be created by cascading primitive one hour `Pipe` s to form the proper length. Each

`Pipe` primitive represents one hour of travel (one clock). In this diagram, a `Pipe4` model is inserted
between the `Seattle Hub` and `Maui Destination` for a four hour flight leg. Since travel can occur in
either direction between `Anchorage` and `Seattle`, a `Pipe5` is inserted between them for each direction.

**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **25 of 94**


**User’s Guide and Tutorial**


Each `Origin` transactor contains a clock control macro and a message input port macro to receive
departure tokens from the `Scheduler` on the software side. Each received token is passed to the

`TokenOut` port when the scheduled departure time has matured. Although the `Origin` transactor has a
clock control macro, it does not actively control the clock. Its only use of the clock control macro is to
monitor the `ReadyForCclock` signal to know on which uclocks the cclock is active so that it can
properly count cclocks until the scheduled departure time of a pending departure token.


Each `Destination` transactor contains a clock control macro and a message output port macro to send
arrival tokens back to the `Scheduler` on the software side. The arrival tokens represent a passenger
emerging from the `RouteMap` mesh and arriving at a `Destination` through its `TokenIn` port. See section
3.2.3.4 on page 26 for a detailed description of the `Destination` transactor. This transactor was chosen
to be described in detail because it provides a simple example of clock control and message port
interfacing.


Each token is a 32-bit vector signal. There are no handshakes in the system. Rather, the tokens are “self
announcing.” Normally, 0s are clocked through the mesh so if, on any given cycle, a `Hub` or

`Destination` senses a non-0 value on its input port, it knows it has received a token that needs to be
processed.


Token formats are also shown in Figure 9. A departure token contains the passenger ID, destination ID,
and scheduled time of departure. As the departure token travels through the mesh, it collects layover
information consisting of the IDs of all the `Hub` s encountered before reaching its `Destination`, having
been transformed into an arrival token. The arrival token then has a complete record of layover
information that is passed back to the software side and displayed to the console.


A `Hub` consists of a `Funnel` that accepts tokens from up to four different sources, and a `Nozzle` that
routes a token up to four different destinations. The `Nozzle` contains a small `RouteTable` that is
initialized at the beginning of the simulation with routing information by receiving `TeachRoute` tokens.


**3.2.3.4** **The** `Destination` **Transactor: Interfacing with the DUT and Controlling the Clock**
The `Destination` transactor accepts tokens arriving from a point-of-exit on the `RouteMap` and passes
them to the message output port.


The `Destination` transactor uses clock control to avoid losing potentially successive tokens arriving
from the `RouteMap` (through the `TokenIn` input) to this destination portal. It de-asserts the

`readyForCclock` in the event that a token comes in, but the message output port is not able to take it
because of tokens simultaneously arriving at other destination portals. This way, it guarantees that the
entire `RouteMap` is disabled until all tokens are off-loaded from the requesting `Destination` transactors.


The Verilog source code for the `Destination` transactor is shown in the following listing:

if( transmitReadyIn && !transmitReadyOut ) begin

end
// Decrement cycle count. When count gets down to 1,
// prepare to send a response that the time has expired.
if( readyForCclock && cclockEnabled ) begin
if (cycleCount == 1) begin
transmitReadyOut <= 1;
readyForCclock <= 0;
end
cycleCount <= cycleCount - 1;
end
if( receiveReadyOut == 1 )
transmitReadyOut <= 0;
end // }
end // }
endmodule // }

```

Notice that the `SceMiClockControl` macro references the same cclock as that in the `Destination`
transactor (i.e., uses the default `ClockNum=1` ). This means that the `ClockAdvancer` and the `Destination`


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **29 of 94**


**User’s Guide and Tutorial**


transactor share in the control of the same cclock. In fact there is only one cclock in the entire system
that is specified at the default 1/1 ratio.


Notice also that, although the `ClockAdvancer` handshakes with the message output port, the data that it
sends is always 0. This is because the only thing that the software side needs from the `ClockAdvancer` is
the cycle stamp which is automatically included in each message output response (see 4.3.5.3 on
page 75).


**3.2.4** **The Software Side**
The software side of the Routed design is written completely in SystemC and C++. It is compiled as an
executable program that links with the SCE-MI software side.


**3.2.4.1** **The** `System` **Model: Interconnect of SystemC Modules**
The `System` model is the top level “software netlist” of SystemC modules ( `SC_MODULE()` ). It specifies
the construction and interconnect of the component models as well. A block diagram of the System
model is shown in Figure 10.

SystemC interconnect channels are declared as `sc_link_mp<>` data types. These can be thought of as
abstract signals that interconnect abstract ports. The parametrized data type associated with each

`sc_link_mp<>` denotes the data type of the message that the channel is capable of transferring from an
output abstract port to an input abstract port. Notice that the `todaysDate` channel is declared with a “by
value” data type (i.e., `Routed::Date` ) whereas some of the other channels such as the `announceArrival`
are declared as “by reference” data types (i.e., `const Routed::ArrivalRecord *` ). The former is less


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **31 of 94**


**User’s Guide and Tutorial**


efficient but safer because the message is passed by value and therefore there is no danger of the
receiver corrupting the sender’s data or worse, having the sender’s data go out of scope leaving the
receiver with a possibly dangling reference. However, passing messages by reference is more efficient
but care must be taken in their use. Declaring them as `const` pointers helps alleviate some, but not all of
the safety problems.


Module pointers are declared inside the `SC_MODULE(System)` object and constructed in its SystemC
constructor ( `SC_CTOR(System)` ). After each child module is constructed, its abstract ports are mapped
to one of the declared interconnect channels.


It is important to stress that SystemC channels, while conceptually the same, are distinctly different
from SCE-MI message channels. Both types of channels pass messages, but SystemC channels are
designed strictly to pass messages of arbitrary C++ data types between SystemC modules. An entire
simulation can be built of just software models communicating with each other. See reference [1] for
more details about SystemC interconnect channels.


SCE-MI message channels have a completely different interface and are optimized for implementing
abstraction bridges between a software subsystem and a hardware subsystem. In the use model
presented in this example, their interfaces are encapsulated by SystemC models.


The thick round arrows in Figure 10 represent the SystemC _autonomous threads_ contained in the

`Testbench` and `SceMiDispatcher` modules. These two threads are the only autonomous threads in the
system. All the other code is executed inside _slave threads_ .

**3.2.4.2** **The** `sc_main()` **Routine and Error Handler**
The following listing shows the `sc_main()` routine which is the top level entrypoint to the program. The

`sc_main()` is required when linking to a SystemC kernel facility, but it is very much like a conventional

`main()` C or C++ entrypoint and has the same program argument passing semantics.

```
     static void errorHandler( void */*context*/, SceMiEC *ec ) {
     char buf[32];

     sprintf( buf, “%d”, (int)ec->Type );
     string messageText( “SCE-MI Error[“ );
     messageText += buf;
     messageText += “]: Function: “;
     messageText += ec->Culprit;
     messageText += “\n”;
     messageText += ec->Message;
     throw messageText;
     }

     int sc_main( int argc, char *argv[] ){
     SceMi::RegisterErrorHandler( errorHandler, NULL );
     SceMi *scemi = NULL;

     try {
     SceMiParameters parameters( “./params.scemi” );
     scemi = SceMi::Init( 1, &parameters );

     System system( “system” ); // Instantiate the system.

     //--------------------------------------------------------     // Establish proper bindings between the SCE-MI and the modules
     // that directly interact with it.
     system.dispatcher->Bind( scemi );
     system.calendar ->Bind( scemi );
     system.scheduler ->Bind( scemi );

     //------------------------------------------------     // Kick off SystemC kernel ...
     cerr << “Let ‘er rip !” << endl;
     sc_start(-1);
     }

     catch( string message ) {
     cerr << message << endl;
     cerr << “Fatal Error: Program aborting.” << endl;
     SceMi::ShutDown( scemi );
     return -1;
     }
     catch(...) {
     cerr << “Error: Unclassified exception.” << endl;
     cerr << “Fatal Error: Program aborting.” << endl;
     SceMi::ShutDown( scemi );
     return -1;
     }
     return 0;
     }

```

The first routine defined is the `errorHandler()` . This is the master error handling function that is
registered with the SCE-MI. Whenever an error occurs, this function is called to format the message


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **33 of 94**


**User’s Guide and Tutorial**


before throwing a C++ exception. The exceptions are caught in the `catch { ... }` blocks at the end of
the `sc_main()` routine where they are displayed before exiting the program.


Once the error handler is registered, the SCE-MI is initialized by calling `SceMi::Init()` . This method
returns a pointer to an `SceMi` object that manages the whole SCE-MI software side infrastructure.


Next the `System` model described in the previous section is constructed. The constructor
( `SC_CTOR(System)` ) causes all of its child software models to get constructed by calling, in turn, their

`SC_CTOR()` constructors.


Once the whole system is statically constructed, models that interface with SCE-MI are given the
master `SceMi` object pointer so that they can access its methods, by calling special `::Bind()` accessor
methods on those models.


Finally, the SystemC main kernel loop is initialized by calling the `sc_start()` function. The -1
parameter tells it to go indefinitely until the program decides to end. How the program ends is explained
in the next section.


**3.2.4.3** **The** `SceMiDispatcher` **Module: Interfacing with the SCE-MI Service Loop**
The `SceMiDispatcher` module contains an _autonomous thread_ that yields to the SCE-MI infrastructure
so that it may service its message port proxies, by making repeated calls to the `SceMi::ServiceLoop()`
method (see section 4.3.3.6 on page 68). By placing this logic on its own dedicated thread, other models
in the system do not have to worry about yielding to the SCE-MI.


**34 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**User’s Guide and Tutorial**


Following is the source code for the `SceMiDispatcher` :

```
SC_MODULE( SceMiDispatcher ){
sc_slave<> Done;

private:
//------------------------------------------------------// Context declarations
SceMi *dSceMi;

//------------------------------------------------------// Thread declarations
void dispatchThread(); // Autonomous SceMi dispatcher thread
void doneThread(){
SceMi::ShutDown( dSceMi );
exit(0); // This is a normal exit.
}
public:
//------------------------------------------------------// Accessors
void Bind( SceMi *scemi ){ dSceMi = scemi; };

SC_CTOR( SceMiDispatcher ){
//-------------------------------------// Thread bindings
SC_THREAD( dispatchThread );
sensitive << UTick;

SC_SLAVE( doneThread, Done );
}
};
void SceMiDispatcher::dispatchThread() {
// This is all the dispatcher does
// It just calls the SceMi dispatcher poll function and returns.
for(;;){
wait();
dSceMi->ServiceLoop();
}
}

```

Between each call to the service loop, the autonomous thread yields to other threads in the system by
calling the `wait()` function. Actually, the only other autonomous thread in the `Routed` system is the one
in the `Testbench` model. Both of these threads are represented by the thick round arrows in Figure 10 on
page 30.


The other job of the `SceMiDispatcher` is shut down the system when it detects a notification on its `Done`
port that the simulation is complete. The `Done` _inslave_ port is bound to the _slave thread_,

`::doneThread()` on construction. The `Done` port is driven from its associated _outmaster_ port on the

`Testbench` module, so it is the `Testbench` that ultimately decides when the simulation is complete (see
next section).

**3.2.4.5** **The** `Testbench` **Model: Main Control Loop**
The `Testbench` model contains a SystemC autonomous thread that serves as the main driver for the

`Routed` design. Its job is to look at the four passenger itineraries and schedule the legs in those
itineraries on the appropriate dates and at the appropriate departure times by interacting with the

`Scheduler` model.


The condensed source code for the passenger itinerary declarations for the `Testbench` model is as
follows:

```
     const Routed::Itinerary Routed::BugsesTrip[] = {
     /*
     On day,   at,         departs from,    enroute to,      */

There are four passengers whose itineraries are given as lists of `Routed::Itinerary` records. Each
record represents a leg of that passenger’s journey consisting of a date of departure, time of departure,
passenger, origin, and destination. The `passengerNames` and `locationNames` are strings use for printing
of messages.


Following is the SystemC module definition ( `SC_MODULE()` ) for the `Testbench` model with its standard
SystemC constructor ( `SC_CTOR()` ):

```

           unsigned dNumMauiArrivals;
           unsigned dDayNum;

           dItineraries[3] = Routed::SylvestersTrip;

           };

```

Following is the autonomous thread for the main driver loop:

```
void Testbench::driverThread(){
LoadRouteMap(); // Signal RouteConfig model to begin configuration RouteMap.
unsigned dayNum = dDayNum;
AdvanceCalendar = 1; // Advance to day 1.

for(;;){
wait(); // Wait for day to advance (i.e., ‘NewDay’ arrives.)

if( dayNum != dDayNum ){
unsigned date, minDate = 1000;

// Check itineraries to see if any passengers are
// traveling today. If so, advance calendar to tomorrow
// in case next leg of itinerary is tomorrow.
for( int i=0; i<Routed::NumPassengers; i++ ){
if( (date=dItineraries[i]->DateOfTravel) ){
if( date == dDayNum ){
cout << “On day “ << setw(2) << dDayNum << “ at “
<< setw(2) << dItineraries[i]->TimeOfDeparture
<< “:00 hrs, “
<< passengerNames[dItineraries[i]->PassengerID]
<< “ departs “
<< locationNames[dItineraries[i]->OriginID]
<< “ enroute to “
<< locationNames[dItineraries[i]->DestinationID]
<< endl;

ScheduleLeg = dItineraries[i]++;
minDate = dDayNum+1;
}
else if( date < minDate )
minDate = date;
}
}
dayNum = dDayNum;
AdvanceCalendar = minDate - dDayNum;
}
}
}

```

Before entering its main loop, the autonomous `::driverThread()` does two things. First, by signaling
the `LoadRouteMap` outmaster port, it triggers the `RouteConfig` model to teach all the routes to the

`RouteTable` s of all the `Hub` s in the `RouteMap` . Each taught route that is injected to the hardware is
staggered by one clock. These small one clock advances are achieved when the `RouteConfig` model
signals the `AdvanceClock` port on the `Calendar` model. Passenger travel in the `RouteMap` is not possible
until all the `Hub` s have been properly programmed with their routes.


Once all the routes have been taught to the `RouteMap`, the `Calendar` is advanced to day one. This will, in
turn, cause the `Calendar` model to announce the arrival of day one via the `NewDay` inslave port. Once the
day change has been detected, the `::driverThread()` then enters into a loop where it schedules any
travel on the itineraries scheduled for the current day. If no travel is scheduled, it advances the `Calendar`
to the first day on which travel is scheduled to occur. Legs of each itinerary are scheduled by sending
the `Itinerary` record over the `ScheduleLeg` outmaster port to the `Scheduler` model which encodes it
into a token and sends it to the hardware.


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **39 of 94**


**User’s Guide and Tutorial**


This operation continues for each leg of each itinerary until all passengers have traveled all legs of their
trip and have finally arrived at the `Maui` `Destination` . This serves as the termination condition that is
conveyed to the `SceMiDispatcher` model by signaling the `Done` outmaster port (see code for

`::announceArrivalThread()` below). Upon receiving this notification, the `SceMiDispatcher` model
gracefully shuts down the SCE-MI and exits the program with a normal exit status.


The `Testbench` model also announces arrivals of passengers at their destinations as they occur. The

`::announceArrivalThread()` slave thread detects an arrival by receiving an `ArrivalRecord` on its

`AnnounceArrival` inslave port (which was sent from the message output port proxy receive callback in
the `Scheduler` ). It prints out the arrival information to the console. Following is the source code:

```
           void Testbench::announceArrivalThread(){
           const Routed::ArrivalRecord *arrivalRecord = AnnounceArrival;

           cout << “On day “ << setw(2) << arrivalRecord->DateOfArrival
           << “ at “ << setw(2) << arrivalRecord->TimeOfArrival << “:00 hrs,\n”
           << “  “ << passengerNames[arrivalRecord->PassengerID]
           << “ arrives in “ << locationNames[arrivalRecord->DestinationID]
           << “  from “ << locationNames[arrivalRecord->OriginID]
           << “ after layovers in,”;

           for( unsigned i=0; i<arrivalRecord->LayoverCount; i++ )
           cout << “\n    “
           << locationNames[arrivalRecord->LayoverIDs[i]];
           cout << endl;
           // Check for termination condition.
           if(   arrivalRecord->DestinationID == Routed::Maui &&
           ++dNumMauiArrivals == Routed::NumPassengers ){
           cout << “Everyone has arrived in Maui. We’re done. Let’s party !”
           << endl;
           Done(); // Signal the dispatcher that the simulation has ended.
           }

           };

```

There are two slave threads defined in this model: the `::scheduleLegThread()` and the

`::loadRouteThread()` . The `::loadRouteThread()`, though not described in detail here, is responsible
for sending `TeachRoute` tokens into the `RouteMap` mesh via the `Waltham Origin` transactor when the

`RouteMap` is first being configured at the beginning of the simulation. This thread is activated each time
the `RouteConfig` module wants to teach a new route during its `LoadRouteMap` operation.


The `::scheduleLegThread()` is activated when the `Scheduler` receives `Routed::Itinerary` messages
on its `ScheduleLeg` inslave port from the `Testbench` model. It sends those legs encoded as departure
tokens across the message input channels to their designated `Origin` transactors. The `Scheduler` has
pointers to each of the message input port proxies that are connected to `Origin` transactors. Each
departure token is encoded with the passenger ID and destination ID from the `Routed::Itinerary`
record. Following is the source code for the `::scheduleLegThread()` :

```
           void Scheduler::scheduleLegThread(){
           const Routed::Itinerary *leg = ScheduleLeg;

           // Form a ‘Passenger Departure’ token based on the contents of the given
           // ‘Itinerary’ record.
           SceMiU32 passengerDepartureToken =
           leg->PassengerID      |
           (leg->DestinationID  << 4) |
           (leg->OriginID    << 12) |
           (leg->TimeOfDeparture << 16);

           dSendData.Set( 0, passengerDepartureToken );

           switch( leg->OriginID ){
           case Routed::Anchorage: dOriginAnchorage->Send( dSendData ); break;
           case Routed::Cupertino: dOriginCupertino->Send( dSendData ); break;
           case Routed::Noida:   dOriginNoida  ->Send( dSendData ); break;
           case Routed::SealBeach: dOriginSealBeach->Send( dSendData ); break;
           case Routed::UK:    dOriginUK    ->Send( dSendData ); break;
           case Routed::Waltham:  dOriginWaltham ->Send( dSendData ); break;
           default:
           assert(0);
           }
           }

```

The `Scheduler::Bind()` method is called prior to simulation from the `sc_main()` routine (see section
Figure 3.2.4.2 on page 33). Here is where the SCE-MI message input and output port proxies leading to
each of the `Origin` and `Destination` transactors are bound. Notice that for each of the output port


**42 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**User’s Guide and Tutorial**


proxies, the output receive callback, `replyCallback()`, is specified in the binding structure. See section
4.3.3.5 on page 67 for more information about message output port binding.

```
void Scheduler::Bind( SceMi *scemi ){

// Establish message input portals.
dOriginAnchorage = scemi->BindMessageInPort( “anchorage”, “TokenIn” );
dOriginCupertino = scemi->BindMessageInPort( “cupertino”, “TokenIn” );
dOriginNoida   = scemi->BindMessageInPort( “noida”,   “TokenIn” );
dOriginSealBeach = scemi->BindMessageInPort( “sealBeach”, “TokenIn” );
dOriginUK    = scemi->BindMessageInPort( “uk”,    “TokenIn” );
dOriginWaltham  = scemi->BindMessageInPort( “waltham”,  “TokenIn” );

// Establish message output portals.
SceMiMessageOutPortBinding binding = { this, replyCallback, NULL };
dDestinationAnchorage = scemi->BindMessageOutPort(
“anchorage”, “TokenOut”, &binding );
dDestinationCupertino = scemi->BindMessageOutPort(
“cupertino”, “TokenOut”, &binding );
dDestinationMaui   = scemi->BindMessageOutPort(
“maui”,   “TokenOut”, &binding );
dDestinationSealBeach = scemi->BindMessageOutPort(
“sealBeach”, “TokenOut”, &binding );
dDestinationUK    = scemi->BindMessageOutPort(
“uk”,    “TokenOut”, &binding );
}

```

The `Scheduler` is also responsible for processing of arrivals. Once the `Calendar` is advanced, arrivals
can occur at any time over the course of 24 hours (i.e., 24 clocks). Each arrival token is sent by a

`Destination` transactor, over a message output port to the `Scheduler` . The SCE-MI infrastructure
dispatches the arriving messages to the `replyCallback()` function that was registered in the `::Bind()`
method described above. The `replyCallback()` function, in turn, passes the message to the private

`::announceArrival()` method described below. Following is the code for the `replyCallback()`
function:

```
void Scheduler::replyCallback( void *context, const SceMiMessageData *data ){
((Scheduler *)context)->announceArrival( data->CycleStamp(), data->Get(0) ); }

```

The `::announceArrival()` method processes the arrival token. It converts the encoded arrival token to
the `Routed::ArrivalRecord` data type, stamps it with `TodaysDate` (an output from the `Calendar` ), and


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **43 of 94**


**User’s Guide and Tutorial**


sends it out through the `AnnounceArrival` outmaster port to the `Testbench` model which displays the
arrival information to the console as follows:

```
           void Scheduler::announceArrival( SceMiU64 cycleStamp, SceMiU32 arrivalToken ){
           Routed::Date todaysDate = TodaysDate; // Read today’s date from Calendar

           dArrivalRecord.DateOfArrival = todaysDate.Day;
           dArrivalRecord.TimeOfArrival = cycleStamp - todaysDate.CycleStamp;
           dArrivalRecord.PassengerID  = (Routed::PassengerIDs)
           ( arrivalToken    & 0xf );
           dArrivalRecord.DestinationID = (Routed::LocationIDs)
           ( (arrivalToken >> 4) & 0xf );
           dArrivalRecord.OriginID   = (Routed::LocationIDs)
           ( (arrivalToken >> 12) & 0xf );
           dArrivalRecord.LayoverCount = (arrivalToken >> 8) & 0xf ;
           assert( dArrivalRecord.LayoverCount < 5 );
           arrivalToken >>= 16;
           for( unsigned i=0; i<dArrivalRecord.LayoverCount; i++ ){
           dArrivalRecord.LayoverIDs[i] = (Routed::LocationIDs)
           ( arrivalToken & 0xf );
           arrivalToken >>= 4;
           }
           AnnounceArrival = &dArrivalRecord; // Arrival record is passed by reference.
           }

```

**3.2.4.7** **The** `Calendar` **Module: Interfacing with the Clock Advancer**
The `Calendar` model is responsible for advancing time on the `RouteMap` one or more days at a time.
Once a set of scheduled departures has been programmed in each `Origin` transactor that has departures
scheduled for a particular day, the `Calendar` allows the DUT to advance by 24 clocks (24 hours) or
some multiple of 24 clocks if the next scheduled departure occurs more than one day from now. The

`Calendar` advances time by sending a message to the `ClockAdvancer` transactor in the hardware which
has direct control of the DUT clock via the `ClockControl` macro. The source code for the `Calendar`
module is very similar in structure to that for the `Scheduler` ; therefore, most of it is not shown here.


The `Calendar` model has two slave threads that respond to requests to advance time. The

`::advanceCalendarThread()` responds to requests on the `AdvanceCalendar` port to advance a given
number of days.


**44 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**User’s Guide and Tutorial**


The `::advanceClockThread()` responds to requests to advance one clock at a time which occurs during

`RouteMap` configuration to stagger the injection of each `TeachRoute` token by one clock. This method is
as follows:

```
void Calendar::advanceClockThread(){
dSendData.Set( 0, 1 );     // Tell ClockAdvancer to advance by 1 clock.
dInputPort->Send( dSendData ); // Send message out on port proxy.

// Pend until the cycle stamp gets updated by the output port proxy reply callback.
SceMiU64 currentCycleStamp = dCycleStamp;
while( dCycleStamp == currentCycleStamp )
wait();
}

```

Notice that this method enters a loop that calls `wait()` to yield to the SystemC kernel. The reason for
this is that it wants to guarantee that the clock has completed its advance before returning. By yielding
to the SystemC kernel while it is waiting for this condition, the autonomous `SceMiDispatcher` thread
(see section 3.2.4.3 on page 34) is naturally given a chance to service the message output ports. This is
necessary to reach the condition that the `::advanceClockThread()` is waiting for, namely, for the

`Calendar::dCycleStamp` data member to change value.


The `::dCycleStamp` changes value when the `ClockAdvancer` (on the hardware side) responds on its
output port that it has completed its one clock time advance which, in turn, causes the

`Calendar::replyCallback()` function to get called from the `SceMi::ServiceLoop()` . The

`replyCallback()` function is as follows:

```
void Calendar::replyCallback( void *context, const SceMiMessageData *data ){
((Calendar *)context)->dCycleStamp = data->CycleStamp(); }

```

The cycle stamp is updated directly from the `::CycleStamp()` method on the `SceMiMessageData` object.
This reflects a count of elapsed controlled clock counts that had occurred from the beginning of the
simulation to the time this message was sent from the hardware side. This is a convenient way for
software to keep track of elapsed clock time in the hardware. Once the `::dCycleStamp` is updated, the

`wait()` loop in the `::advanceClockThread()` described above, is released and the function can return.


Keep in mind the `::advanceClockThread()` and `replyCallback()` functions are being called under two
different autonomous threads that each frequently yield to each other. The former is called from the
autonomous `Testbench::driverThread()` and the latter is called ultimately from the

`SceMi::ServiceLoop()` function that is called from underneath the autonomous

`SceMiDispatcher::dispatchThread()` . This illustrates the clean interaction between a general multithreaded application software environment and the SCE-MI service loop.

Briefly, the dual ready handshake works as follows. The transmitter asserts `TransmitReady` on any
clock cycle when it has data, and de-asserts when it does not. The receiver asserts `ReceiveReady` on any
cycle when it is ready for data, and de-asserts when it is not. In any clock cycle in which `TransmitReady`
and `ReceiveReady` are both asserted, data “moves” meaning that it is taken by the receiver.


The dual ready protocol has the following two advantages:

**`•`** Signals are level-based; therefore, they are easily sampled by posedge clocked logic

**`•`** However, if both `TransmitReady` and `ReceiveReady` stay asserted, sequences of data can still move
every clock cycle and therefore, the same performance can be realized as, for example, a _toggle_
based protocol.

**4.1.2** **`SceMiMessageInPort`** **Macro**
The `SceMiMessageInPort` macro presents messages arriving from the software side of a channel to the
transactor. The macro consists of two handshake signals that play a dual-ready protocol and a data bus
that presents the message itself. Figure 12 shows the symbol for the `SceMiMessageInPort` macro as well
as Verilog and VHDL source code for the empty macro wrappers.

The message width in bits is derived from the setting of this parameter.

```
     PortName
```

The port’s name is derived from its instance label.

```
     ReceiveReady
```

A value of one on this signal indicates that the transactor is ready to accept data from the software. By
asserting this signal, the hardware indicates to the software that it has a location into which it can put
any data that might arrive on the message input port. When a new message arrives, as indicated by the

`TransmitReady` and `ReceiveReady` both being true, that location is consumed (see Figure 11 on
page 46). When this happens, a notification is sent to the software side that a new empty location is
available and this triggers an _input ready callback_ to occur on the software side (see section 4.1.2.2 on
page 48). The next section explains in detail when input ready propagation notifications are done with
respect to the timing of the `TransmitReady` and `ReceiveReady` handshakes.


Note that it is possible for transactors not to utilize `ReceiveReady` and the input ready callback. If this is
the case, the `ReceiveReady` input must be permanently asserted (i.e., “tied high”) and, on the software
side, no input ready callback is registered. In this case, `TransmitReady` merely acts as a strobe for each


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **47 of 94**


**Formal Functional Specification**


arriving message. The transactor must be designed to take any arriving data immediately as it is not
guaranteed to be held for subsequent uclock cycles.

```
           TransmitReady
```

A value of one on this signal sampled on any posedge of the uclock indicates that the channel has
message data ready for the transactor to take. If `ReceiveReady` is not asserted, the `TransmitReady`
remains asserted until and during the first clock in which `ReceiveReady` finally becomes asserted.
During this clock data moves and, if no more messages have arrived from the software side, the

`TransmitReady` is de-asserted.

```
           Message
```

This vector signal constitutes the payload data of the message.


**4.1.2.2** **Input Ready Propagation**
If the software client code registers an input ready callback when it first binds to a message input port
proxy (see section 4.3.3.4 on page 66), the hardware side of the infrastructure must notify the software
side each time it is ready for more input. Each time it is so notified, the port proxy on the software side
makes a call to the user registered input ready callback. This mechanism is called _input ready_
_propagation_ . The prototype for the input ready callback is as follows:

```
              void (*IsReady)(void *context);

```

When this function is called, a software model can assume that a message can be sent to the message
input port proxy for transmission to the message input port on the hardware side. The `context` argument
can be a pointer to any user-defined object, presumably the software model that has bound the proxy.


An important point to note is that it is totally up to the application to follow the protocol that if, the
transactor is not ready to receive input, the software model should not do a send. A well behaved
software model should know not to do a send if it has not received an input ready callback (assuming
the input ready propagation mechanism is being deployed).


The SCE-MI infrastructure will not enforce this. So, the idea is that, when the transactor wants to say,
"I'm ready for input", it will assert the `ReceiveReady` input to the `SceMiMessageInPort` which will
cause an input ready callback to be called on the software side, the next time `::ServiceLoop()` is
entered. The software model should then typically either set a flag that can be consulted later on outside

`::ServiceLoop(),` indicating that the transactor is ready for input, or, in some cases, it may choose to
do a send right then and there (i.e. inside the callback). The point is that a send should not be done by
the software model until some time (either immediately or deferred) after the input ready callback has
been received.


A second point to be made is that it should be fine for an application to service as many output callbacks
as is desired while pending an input callback. In other words, the software model may have an outer
loop that checks the status of an application defined _OKToSend_ flag on each iteration and skips the send
if the flag is false.


So suppose an application has an outer loop that repeatedly calls `::ServiceLoop()` and checks for
arriving output messages and input ready notifications. Each callback function sets a flag in the context
that the outer loop uses to know if an output message has arrived and needs processing, or an input port
needs more input.


**48 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**


It is possible that, before an input ready callback gets called, that outer loop may have called

`::ServiceLoop()` say 50 times each time resulting in an output message callback and the subsequent
processing of that output message.


Finally, on the 51'st time `::ServiceLoop()` is called, the input ready callback is called which sets the
_OKToSend_ flag in its context, after which the outer loop would detect the new flag status and initiate a
send on that input channel.


The handshake waveforms in Figure 11 on page 46 are intended purely to illustrate the semantics of the
dual ready protocol. There can be a couple of reasons why these waveforms might not be realistic in an
actual implementation of a `SceMiMessageInPort` macro. First, if input ready propagation is enabled
(because an optional callback was registered on the software side), the sender on the software side
might expect input ready notifications before transmitting messages so that two back-to-back messages,
and hence `TransmitReady` assertions on consecutive clocks might be impossible. Second, even if input
ready callbacks were not registered on a given port, the timing of the physical layer of the SCE-MI
bridge might be such that two successive transmissions are not possible unless the software end
somehow batched consecutive message transmissions to the hardware.


All of this said however, the hardware in the transactor should be designed so as to anticipate any of the
above scenarios whether or not they are likely to happen.


The waveforms shown in Figure 13 are typical of what one might see with input ready callbacks
enabled. It shows four possible scenarios in which an input ready notification occurs.

In the depicted scenarios, an input ready notification is propagated to the software if,

**`•`** `ReceiveReady` from transactor is asserted in the first clock following a reset or,

**`•`** `ReceiveReady` from transactor transitions from a 0 to a 1 or,

**`•`** `ReceiveReady` from transactor remains asserted in a clock following one in which a transfer
occurred due to a assertions on both `TransmitReady` and `ReceiveReady` .


**4.1.3** **`SceMiMessageOutPort`** **Macro**
The `SceMiMessageOutPort` macro allows transactors to send messages to the software side. Like the

`SceMiMessageInPort` macro, it also uses a dual ready handshake except that in this case, the transmitter
is the transactor and the receiver is the SCE-MI interface. A transactor can have any number of

`SceMiMessageOutPort` macro instances. Figure 14 shows the symbol for the `SceMiMessageOutPort`
macro as well as Verilog and VHDL source code for the empty macro wrappers.

**4.1.3.1** **Parameters and Signals**
```
           PortWidth
```

The message width in bits is derived from the setting of this parameter.

```
           PortPriority
```

The priority for determining which output messages are sent to the output channel first, should more
than one arrive on the same uclock. See section 4.2.1 on page 59 for details on the meaning of this
parameter.

```
           PortName
```

The port’s name is derived from its instance label.


**50 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**

```
    TransmitReady
```

A value of one on this signal indicates that the transactor has message data ready for the output channel
to take. If `ReceiveReady` is not asserted, the `TransmitReady` must remain asserted until and during the
first clock in which `ReceiveReady` finally becomes asserted. During this clock data moves and, if the
transactor has no more messages for transmission, it de-asserts the `TransmitReady` .

```
    ReceiveReady
```

A value of one on this signal sampled on any uclock posedge indicates that the output channel is ready
to accept data from the transactor. By asserting this signal, the SCE-MI hardware side indicates to the
transactor that the output channel has a location into which it can put any data that is destined for the
software side of the channel. In any cycle during which both the `TransmitReady` and `ReceiveReady` are
asserted, the transactor can assume that the data moved. If, in the subsequent cycle, the `ReceiveReady`
remains asserted, that means that a new empty location is available which the transactor can load any
time by asserting `TransmitReady` again. Meanwhile, the last message data, upon arrival to the software
side, triggers a _receive callback_ on its message output port proxy (see section 4.3.7.1 on page 77).

```
    Message
```

This vector signal constitutes the payload data of the message originating from the transactor, to be sent
to the software side of the channel.


**4.1.4** **`SceMiClockPort`** **Macro**
The `SceMiClockPort` macro supplies a controlled clock to the DUT. The `SceMiClockPort` macro is
parametrized such that each instance of a `SceMiClockPort` fully specifies a controlled clock of a given
frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle.


The `SceMiClockPort` macro also supplies a controlled reset whose duration is the specified number of
cycles of the cclock.


Figure 15 shows the symbol for the `SceMiClockPort` macro as well as Verilog and VHDL source code
for the empty macro wrappers.

Note that all of the clock parameters have default values. In simpler systems where only one controlled
clock is needed, exactly one instance of a `SceMiClockPort` can be instantiated at the top level with no
parameters specified. This results in a single controlled clock with a ratio of 1/1, a _don’t care duty cycle_
(see discussion of duty cycle in section 4.1.4.3 on page 54), and a phase shift of 0. Ideally, this clock’s
frequency matches that of the uclock during cycles in which it is enabled.


The SCE-MI infrastructure always implicitly creates a controlled clock with a 1/1 ratio which is the
highest frequency controlled clock in the system. Whether or not it is visible to the user’s design
depends on whether a `SceMiClockPort` with a 1/1 ratio is explicitly declared (instantiated).


In more complex systems that require multiple clocks, a `SceMiClockPort` instance must be created for
each required clock. The clock ratio that is specified in the instantiation parameters always specifies the
frequency of the clock as a ratio relative to the highest frequency controlled clock in the system (whose
ratio is 1/1 whether explicitly or implicitly defined).


For example if a cclock is defined with a ratio of 4/1 this is interpreted as, “for every 4 edges of the 1/1
cclock there is only 1 edge of this cclock”. This would be a “divide-by-four” clock.


**4.1.4.1** **Parameters and Signals**
```
           ClockNum=1
```

This parameter is used to assign a unique number to a clock that is used to differentiate it from other

`SceMiClockPort` instances. It shall be considered an error (by the infrastructure linker) if more than one

`SceMiClockPort` instances share the same `ClockNum` . The default `ClockNum` is 1.


**52 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**

```
     RatioNumerator=1, RatioDenominator=1
```

These parameters constitute the numerator and denominator respectively of this clock’s ratio. The
numerator always designates the number of cycles of the fastest 1/1 controlled clock that occur during
the number of cycles of “this” clock specified in the denominator. For example, with

`RatioNumerator=5` and `RatioDenominator=2` a 5/2 clock is specified which means that for every 5
cycles of the 1/1 clock that occur, only 2 cycles of this clock occur. The default clock ratio is 1/1.

```
     DutyHi=0, DutyLo=100, Phase=0
```

The duty cycle is expressed with arbitrary integers that are normalized to their sum such that the sum of

`DutyHi` and `DutyLo` represent the number of units for a whole cycle of the clock. For example, with

`DutyHi=75` and `DutyLo=25` the high time of the clock is 75 out of 100 units or 75% of the period.
Similarly, the low time would be 25% of the period. The phase shift is expressed in the same units so
that if `Phase=30`, that would mean that the clock should be shifted by 30% of its period before the first
low to high transition occurs.


The default duty cycle shown in the macro wrappers in figure 15 above is a _don’t care duty cycle_ of 0/
100 (see section 4.1.4.3 on page 54).

```
     ResetCycles=8
```

This parameter specifies how many cycles of this controlled clock shall occur before the controlled reset
transitions from its initial value of 1 back to 0.

```
     ClockName
```

The clock port’s name is derived from its instance label.

```
     Cclock
```

This is the controlled clock signal that is supplied to the DUT by the SCE-MI infrastructure via this
macro. This clock’s characteristics is derived from the parameters specified on instantiation of this
macro.

```
     Creset
```

This is the controlled reset signal that is supplied to the DUT by the SCE-MI infrastructure via this
macro.


**4.1.4.2** **Deriving Clock Ratios from Frequencies**
Another way of to specify clock ratios is enter them directly as frequencies all normalized to the clock
with the highest frequency. To specify ratios this way requires the following:

**`•`** make each ratio numerator equal to the highest frequency

**`•`** use consistent units for all ratios

**`•`** omit those units and simply state them as integers


For example, suppose a system has 100Mhz, 25Mhz, and 10Mhz, 7.5 Mhz, and 32kHz clocks. To
specify the ratios, the frequencies can be directly entered as integers using kHz as the unit (but omitting
it !):


100000 / 100000 - the fastest clock

100000 / 25000

100000 / 10000


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **53 of 94**


**Formal Functional Specification**


100000 / 7500

100000 / 32


Users who like to think in frequencies rather than ratios can use this simple technique. It is also possible
that an implementor of the SCE-MI API may wish to provide a tool to assist in deriving clock ratios
from frequencies. Such a tool could allow a user to enter clock specifications in terms of frequencies
and then generate a set of equivalent ratios.


In addition, the tool could post process waveforms (such as .vcd files) generated by the simulation in
such a way that the defined clocks appear in the waveform display to be the exact same frequencies
given by the user.


**4.1.4.3** **Don’t Care Duty Cycle**
The default duty cycle shown in the macro wrappers in figure 15 above is a _don’t care duty cycle_ . Users
can specify that they only care about posedges of the cclock and do not care where the negedge falls.
This is known as a _posedge active don’t care duty cycle_ . In such a case, the `DutyHi` is given as a 0. The

`DutyLo` can be given as an arbitrary number of units such that the `Phase` offset can still be expressed as a
percentage of the whole period (i.e `DutyHi+DutyLo` ).


For example if a user specifies this combination:

```
                DutyHi=0, DutyLo=100, Phase=30

```

The user is saying the following:

**`•`** I don’t care about the duty cycle. Specifically I don’t care where the negedge of the clock falls.

**`•`** If the total period is expressed as 100 units (0+100), the phase should be shifted by 30 of those
units. This represents a phase shift of 30%.


Another example:

```
                DutyHi=3, DutyLo=1, Phase=2

```

This says,

**`•`** I care about both intervals of the duty cycle. Duty cycle is 75%/25%.

**`•`** Phase shift is 50% of period (expressed as 3+1 units).


It is also possible to have a _negedge active don’t care duty cycle_ . In this case, the `DutyLo` parameter is
given as a 0 and the `DutyHi` is given as a positive number > 0.


For example:

```
                DutyHi=1, DutyLo=0, Phase=0

```

It means,

**`•`** I don’t care about duty cycle. Specifically I don’t care where the posedge of a clock falls.

**`•`** Phase shift is 0.


In any clock specification, it is considered an error if `Phase >= DutyHi + DutyLo` .


**54 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**


**4.1.4.4** **Controlled Reset Semantics**
The `Creset` output of the `SceMiClockPort` macro shall obey the following semantics:

**`•`** `Creset` will start low (deasserted) and transition to high one or more uclocks later. It will then
remain high (asserted) for a at least a minimum duration specified by the `ResetCycles` parameter
adorning the `SceMiClockPort` macro. This duration is expressed as a number of edges of associated

`Cclock` . Following the reset duration, the `Creset` will then go low (deasserted) and remain low for
the remaining duration of the simulation. Some applications require 2 edged resets at the beginning
of a simulation.

**`•`** For multiple cclocks, the reset duration must have a minimum length such that it is guaranteed to
span the `ResetCycles` parameter of any clock. In other words, the controlled reset duration for all
clocks must be, as a mininum,
```
       max( ResetCycles for cclock1, ResetCycles for cclock2, ...)
```

**`•`** Some implementations may chose to use a reset duration that is larger than the quantify shown
above if it is required to achieve proper alignment of multiple cclocks on the edges of the controlled
reset as described in section 4.1.4.5 on page 55.

**`•`** During the assertion of `Creset`, `Cclock` edges shall be forced regardless of the state of the

`ReadyForCclock` inputs to the `SceMiClockControl` macros. Once the reset duration completes, the

`Cclock` will be controlled normally by the `ReadyForCclock` inputs.


Note: The operation of controlled reset just described provides the default controlled reset behavior
generated by the `SceMiClockPort` macro. If more sophisticated reset handling is required it will have
implemented with a specially written reset transactor that is used in lieu of the simpler controlled resets
that come from the `SceMiClockPort` instances. For example, if a software controlled reset is required,
an application would need to create a reset transactor that responds to a special software originated reset
command that arrives on its message input port.


**4.1.4.5** **Multiple Cclock Alignment**
In general, all cclocks should align on the first rising uclock edge following the trailing edge of the
creset. This uclock edge shall be referred to as the _point of alignment_ . For cclocks with phases of 0 this
means that rising edges of these clocks should coincide with the point of alignment. For cclocks with
phases > 0 edges will occur some time after the point of alignment. Figure 16 shows an assortment of
cclocks with the uclock and creset. It also shows how those cclocks behave at the point of alignment.


In the diagram, `cclock1`, `cclock2`, and `cclock3` have phases of 0 and therefore have rising edges at the
point of alignment.


`cclock4` has the same duty cycle as `cclock2` but a phase shift of 50%. Therefore its rising edge occurs
2 uclocks (1/2 cycle) after the point of alignment. Its _starting value_ at the point of alignment is still 0.


`cclock5` has the same duty cycle as cclock3 but a phase of 50%. Again, its rising edge occurs 1/2 cycle
after the point of alignment. But notice that its starting value at the point of alignment is 1. This can be
alternatively thought of as an _inverted phase_ . Anytime the phase is greater than the initial duty cycle
interval, the starting value at the point of alignment will be a 1.

**4.1.5** **`SceMiClockControl`** **Macro**
For every `SceMiClockPort` macro instance there must be at least one counterpart `SceMiClockControl`
macro instance presumably encapsulated in a transactor. The `SceMiClockControl` macro is the means
by which a transactor can control a DUT’s clock and by which the SCE-MI infrastructure can indicate
to a transactor on which _uclock_ cycles that _controlled clock_ have edges.


Figure 17 shows the symbol for the `SceMiClockControl` macro as well as Verilog and VHDL source
code for the empty macro wrappers.

```


For each `SceMiClockPort` defined in the system, at least one corresponding `SceMiClockControl` macro
must be instantiated in one or more transactors. In addition to providing uncontrolled clocks and resets,
this macro also provides handshakes that provide explicit control of both edges of the generated cclock.


**4.1.5.1** **Parameters and Signals**
```
     ClockNum=1
```

This is the only parameter given to the `SceMiClockControl` macro. This parameter is used to associate a

`SceMiClockControl` instance with its counterpart `SceMiClockPort` instance that is defined at the top
level. The default `ClockNum` is 1.


Note that associated with each instance of `SceMiClockControl` there must be exactly one instance in the
system of `SceMiClockPort` . But for each instance of `SceMiClockPort`, there can be one or more
instances of `SceMiClockControl` . A `SceMiClockControl` instance identifies the `SceMiClockPort` it is
associated with by properly specifying a `ClockNum` parameter matching that of its associated

`SceMiClockPort` .

```
     Uclock
```

This is the uncontrolled clock signal generated by the SCE-MI infrastructure.

```
     Ureset
```

This is the uncontrolled reset generated by the SCE-MI infrastructure. This signal is high at the


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **57 of 94**


**Formal Functional Specification**


beginning of simulated time and transitions to a low an arbitrary (implementation dependent) number of
uclocks later. It can be used to reset the transactor.


Note: The uncontrolled reset must have a duration spanning that of the longest controlled reset ( `Creset`
output from each `SceMiClockPort`            - see section 4.1.4.4 on page 55) as measured in uclocks. This
guarantees that all DUTs and transactors properly wake up in an initialized state the first uclock
following expiration of the last controlled reset.

```
           ReadyForCclock
```

This input to the macro indicates to the SCE-MI infrastructure that a transactor is willing to allow its
associated DUT clock to advance. The transactor de-asserts this signal when it needs to perform
operations during which the DUT must be frozen. One of the most useful applications of this feature is
to perform complex algorithmic operations on the data content of a transaction before presenting it to
the DUT.


If this input to one of the `SceMiClockControl` instances that are associated with a given controlled clock
is deasserted, the next posedge of that cclock will be disabled. In reacting to a `ReadyForCclock` of a
slower clock, the infrastructure must not prematurely disable posedges of other faster clocks that occur
prior to the last possible uclock preceding the edge to be disabled. In other words, that edge is disabled
“just in time” so as to allow faster clock activity to proceed until the last moment possible. Once the
edge is finally disabled, all posedges of all controlled clocks are also disabled.

```
           ReadyForCclockNegEdge
```

Similarly, for negedge control, if this input to one of the `SceMiClockControl` instances that are
associated with a given controlled clock is deasserted, the next negedge of that clock will be disabled. In
reacting to a `ReadyForCclockNegEdge` of a slower clock, the infrastructure must not prematurely
disable negedges of other faster clocks that occur prior to the last possible uclock preceding the edge to
be disabled. In other words, that edge is disabled “just in time” so as to allow faster clock activity to
proceed until the last moment possible. Once the edge is finally disabled, all negedges of all controlled
clocks are also disabled.


Support for explicit negedge control is needed because without it, transactor logic that only cares about
controlling posedge clocks could not inadvertently disable the next negedge of a clock when it only
intended to disable the next posedge of a clock. Transactors that do not care about controlling negedges
(such as the one shown in Figure 5 on page 17) should tie this signal high.

```
           CclockEnabled
```

This macro output signals the transactor that on the next posedge of uclock there is a posedge of the
controlled clock. The transactor can thus sample this signal to know if a DUT clock edge occurs. The
SCE-MI infrastructure looks at the `ReadyForCclock` from all the transactors and asserts `CclockEnabled`
only if they are all asserted. This means that any transactor can stop all the clocks in the system by
simply de-asserting `ReadyForCclock` .


Note: for a _negedge active don’t care duty cycle_ (see 4.1.4.3 on page 54), since the user does not care
about the posedge, the `CclockEnabled` will always be 0.

```
           CclockNegEdgeEnabled
```

This signal works like `CclockEnabled` except that it indicates if the negedge of a controlled clock
occurs on the next posedge of the uclock. This can be useful for transactors that control double pumped
DUTs. Transactors that do not care about negedge control can ignore this signal.


**58 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**


Note: for a _posedge active don’t care duty cycle_ (see 4.1.4.3 on page 54), since the user does not care
about the negedge, the `CclockNegEdgeEnabled` will always be 0.


**4.2 Infrastructure Linkage**

The contents of this section is strictly the concern of the _infrastructure implementor_ class of user, as
defined in section 2.2.3 on page 8. _End users_ and _transactor implementors_ can assume that the
operations described herein are automatically handled by the _infrastructure linker_ .


As described in section 2.4.2 on page 14, _infrastructure linkage_ is the process that analyzes the user’s
bridge netlist on the hardware side and compiles it into a form suitable to run on the emulator. This may
involve expanding the interface macros into infrastructure components that are added to the existing
structure as well as to generate parameter information that is used to bind the hardware side to the
software side. In order to determine this information, the infrastructure linker analyzes the netlist and
searches for instances of the SCE-MI hardware side macros, read the parameter values from those
instances, and generate a parameters file that can be read during software side initialization to properly
bind message port proxies to the hardware side.


It can also be typical for the infrastructure linker to provide options either in the form of switches and/or
an input configuration file that allow a user to pass along or override implementation specific options. A
well crafted infrastructure linker however, should maximize ease-of-use by transparently providing the
end user with a suitable set of default values for implementation specific parameters, so that most, if not
all of these parameters need not be overridden.


**4.2.1** **Parameters**
The following set of parameters define the minimum set that is needed for all implementations of the
SCE-MI standard. Specific implementations might require additional parameters.


**Number of Transactors**
The number of transactors shall be derived by counting the number of modules in the user’s design that
contain `SceMiClockControl` macros. It shall be assumed that any module that is to be officially
considered a transactor must have at least one `SceMiClockControl` instance immediately inside it.


**Transactor Name**
The transactor name shall be derived from the hierarchical path name to an instance of a module that
qualifies as a transactor as per the above definition. Naturally, if there are multiple instances of a given
type of transactor, they shall be uniquely distinguished by their instance path names. The syntax used to
express the path name must be that of the HDL language that the bridge netlist is expressed in.


**Number of Message Input or Output Channels**
The infrastructure linker derives the number of message input and output ports by counting instances of
the `SceMiMessageInPort` and `SceMiMessageOutPort` macros.


**Port Name**
The name of each port shall be derived from the relative instance path name to that port relative to its
containing transactor module. For example, if the full path name to a message input port macro instance
is, using Verilog notation, `Bridge.u1.tx1.ip1` and the transactor name is `Bridge.u1.tx1`, then the port
name is `ip1` . If an output port is instantiated one level down from the input port and its full path is


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **59 of 94**


**Formal Functional Specification**


`Bridge.u1.tx1.m1.op1,` then its port name is `m1.op1` since it is instantiated a level down relative to the
transactor root level.


The full pathname to a port can be derived by concatenating the transactor name to the port name (with
a hierarchical separator inserted between).


**Message Input or Output Port Width**
The width of a port in bits shall be derived from the `PortWidth` parameter defined in the message port
macro. This width defaults to 1 but is almost always overridden to a significantly larger value at the
point of instantiation.


**Message Output Port Priority**
The priority of a message output port shall be derived from the `PortPrority` parameter defined in the

`SceMiMessageOutPort` macro. For certain implementations, it might be useful as a “hint” to the
infrastructure linker to decide which output ports should be serviced first, should they happen to present
message data on the same uclock, and are implemented over a number of “physical message channels”
that is less than the limitless number of virtual message channels. To some users this might be
important. For those who do not care, the default value of 10 does not need to be overridden and need
not be specified in the instantiation statement.


With some exceptions, the output port priority generally follows the semantics of the UNIX `nice`
command as follows:

**`•`** 0 < allowed priority values < 20

**`•`** Default priority value is 10

**`•`** The lower the number the higher the priority

**`•`** Output port priority 0 is reserved for internal use by the infrastructure

**`•`** For message output ports with the same priority number, their relative priority is undetermined and
strictly an artifact of infrastructure linker implementation


**Number of Controlled Clocks**
This number shall be derived by counting all instances of the `SceMiClockPort` macro.


**Controlled Clock Name**
The name of a controlled clock is derived from the instance label (not path name) of its

`SceMiClockPort` instance, necessarily instantiated at the top level of the user’s bridge netlist and unique
among all instances of `SceMiClockPort` .


**Controlled Clock Ratio**
The clock ratio is determined from the `RatioNumerator` and `RatioDenominator` parameters of the

`SceMiClockPort` macro. The `RatioNumerator` designates the number of cycles of the fastest 1/1
controlled clock that occur during the number of cycles of “this” clock specified in `RatioDenominator` .
See 4.1.4 on page 51 for more details about the clock ratio.


**Controlled Clock Duty Cycle and Phase**
The duty cycle is determined from the `DutyHi`, `DutyLo`, and `Phase` parameters of the `SceMiClockPort`
macro. The duty cycle is expressed as a pair of arbitrary integers, `DutyHi` and `DutyLo` interpreted as
follows: if the sum of `DutyHi` and `DutyLo` represents the number of units in a period of the clock, then

`DutyHi` represents the number of units of high time and `DutyLo`, the number of units of low time.


**60 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**


Similarly, `Phase` represents the number of units the clock is phase shifted relative to the reference 1/1
cclock. It is also possible for a user to specify a _don’t care duty cycle_ . See 4.1.4 on page 51 for more
details about the duty cycle and phase.


**Controlled Reset Cycles**
The duration of a controlled reset expressed in terms of cclock cycles is determined from the

`ResetCycles` parameter of the `ClockPort` macro.


**4.2.1.1** **Parameter File**
A parameter file should be automatically generated by the infrastructure linker after analyzing the user
supplied netlist and determining all the parameters identified in the previous section. The parameter file
can be read by the software side of the SCE-MI infrastructure to facilitate binding operations that occur
after software model construction.


Because it is automatically generated, content and syntax of the parameter file is left to specific
implementors of the SCE-MI. The content itself is not intended to be portable. However, on the
software side, a parameter access API must be provided by the infrastructure implementor that
conforms to the specification in 4.3.4 on page 70. This access block must support access to a
specifically named set of parameters required by the SCE-MI as well as an optional, implementation
specified set of named parameters.


All SCE-MI required parameters are read-only because their values are automatically determined by the
infrastructure linker by analyzing the user supplied netlist. Implementation specific parameters can be
read-only or read-write as required by the implementation.


**4.3 Software Side Interface - C++ API**

To gain access to the hardware side of the SCE-MI, the software side must first initialize the SCE-MI
software side infrastructure and then bind to port proxies representing each message port defined on the
hardware side. Part of initializing the SCE-MI involves instructing the SCE-MI to load the parameter
file that was generated by the infrastructure linker. The information in the parameter file gives the SCEMI software side the means to establish rendezvous with the hardware side in response to port binding
calls from the user’s software models. Rendezvous during port binding is achieved primarily by name
association involving transactor names and port names.


Note that clock names and properties identified in the parameter file are of little significance during the
binding process although this information is procedurally available to applications that might need it
through the parameter file API (see section 4.3.4 on page 70).


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **61 of 94**


**Formal Functional Specification**


Access to the software side of the interface is facilitated by a number of C++ classes that are as follows:

```
           class SceMiEC
           class SceMi
           class SceMiParameters
           class SceMiMessageData
           class SceMiMessageInPortProxy
           class SceMiMessageOutPortProxy

```

**4.3.1** **Primitive Data Types**
In addition to C data types such as `integer`, `unsigned`, and `const char *`, many of the arguments to the
methods in the API require unsigned data types of specific width. To support these, the following data
types are placed in the header files for the API:

```
           typedef unsigned int SceMiU32;
           typedef unsigned long long SceMiU64;

```

**4.3.2** **Miscellaneous Interface Issues**


**4.3.2.1** **class** `SceMiEC` **- Error Handling**
Note that most of the calls in the interface take an `SceMiEC * ec` as the last argument. Because the usage
of this argument is consistent for all methods, error handling semantics are explained in detail in this
section rather than documenting error handling for each method in the API.


Error handling in SCE-MI was designed to be flexible enough to either use a traditional style of error
handling where an error status is returned and checked with each call, or a callback based scheme where
a registered _error handler_ is called when an error occurs.

```
           enum SceMiErrorType {
              SceMiOK,
              SceMiError
           };

           struct SceMiEC {
              const char *Culprit;
              const char *Message;
              SceMiErrorType Type;
              int Id;
           };

           typedef void (*SceMiErrorHandler)(void *context, SceMiEC *ec);

           static void
           SceMi::RegisterErrorHandler(
              SceMiErrorHandler errorHandler,
              void *context );

```

This method registers an optional error handler with the SCE-MI that is to be called in the event that an
error occurs.


When any SCE-MI operation encounters an error, the following procedure is followed:

**`•`** If the `SceMiEC *` pointer passed into the function was non-NULL, the values of the `SceMiEC`
structure are filled out by the errant call with appropriate information describing the error, and
control is returned to the caller. This can be thought of as a _traditional_ approach to error handling


**62 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**


such as one might find in C applications. It is up to the application code to check the error status
after each call to the API and take appropriate abortive action if an error is detected.

**`•`** Else if the `SceMiEC *` pointer passed to the function is NULL (or nothing is passed since the
default is NULL in each API function), and an error handler was registered, that error handler is
called from within the errant API call. The error handler is passed an internally allocated `SceMiEC`
structure filled out with the error information. In this _error handler callback approach_, the
user-defined code within the handler can initiate abort operations. If it is a C++ application, a `catch`
and `throw` mechanism might be deployed. A C application can simply call the `abort()` or `exit()`
function after printing out or logging the error information.

**`•`** Else if the `SceMiEC *` pointer passed to the function is NULL, and no error handler is registered, an

`SceMiEC` structure is constructed and passed to a default error handler. The default error handler
attempts to print a message to the console and to a log file and then calls `abort()` .


It is important to note that this error handling facility only supports irrecoverable errors. This means that
if an error is returned through the `SceMiEC` object, either via a handler or a return object, that there is no
point in continuing with the co-modeling session. Any calls that support returning a recoverable error
status should return that status using a separate, dedicated return argument.


A second point to note is that the `Message` text filled out in the error structure is meant to fully describe
the nature of the error and can be logged or displayed to the console verbatim by the application error
handling code. The `Culprit` text is the name of the errant API function and can optionally be added to
the message that is displayed or logged.


Because every API call returns either a success or fatal error status, and because the detailed nature of
errors is fully described within the returned error message, the `SceMiErrorType` enum has only two
values pertaining to success ( `SceMiOK` ) or failure ( `SceMiError` ). The `SceMiEC::Type` returned from API
functions to the caller can be either of these two values depending on whether the call was a success or
a failure. However the `SceMiEC::Type` passed into an error handler will, by definition, always have the
value `SceMiError`, since otherwise the error handler would not have been called in the first place.


The optional `Id` field can be used further classify different major error types, or even to tag each distinct
error message with a unique integer identifier.


**4.3.2.2** **class** `SceMiIC` **- Informational Status and Warning Handling (Info Handling)**
The SCE-MI also provides a means of conveying warnings and informational status messages to the
application.


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **63 of 94**


**Formal Functional Specification**


Like error handling, _info handling_ is done with callback functions and a special structure that is used to
convey the warning information.

```
           enum SceMiInfoType {
              SceMiInfo,
              SceMiWarning,
              SceMiNonFatalError
           };

           struct SceMiIC {
              const char *Originator;
              const char *Message;
              SceMiInfoType Type;
              int Id;
           };

           typedef void (*SceMiInfoHandler)(void *context, SceMiIC *ic);

           static void
           SceMi::RegisterInfoHandler(
              SceMiInfoHandler infoHandler,
              void *context );

```

This method registers an optional info handler with the SCE-MI that is to be called in the event that a
warning or informational status message occurs.


When any SCE-MI operation encounters a warning or wishes to issue an informational message, the
following procedure is followed:

**`•`** If an info handler was registered, that info handler is called from within the API call that wants to
issue the warning. The info handler is passed an internally allocated `SceMiIC` structure filled out
with the warning information. In this _info handler callback approach_, the user-defined code within
the handler can convey the warning to the user in a manner that is appropriate for that application.
For example, it can be displayed to the console, or logged to a file, or both.

**`•`** Else if no info handler is registered, a `SceMiIC` structure is constructed and passed to a default,
implementation defined error handler. The default error handler can attempt to print a message to
the console and/or to a log file in an implementation specific format.


It is important to note that the `Message` text filled out in the error structure is meant to fully describe the
nature of the info message and can be logged or displayed to the console verbatim by the application’s
warning and info handling code. The `Originator` text is the name of the API function that detected the
message and can optionally be added to the message that is displayed or logged.


The `SceMiInfoType` is an extra piece of information that indicates if the message is a warning or just
some informational status. An additional category called `SceMiNonFatalError` can be used to log all
error conditions leading up to a fatal error. The final fatal error message should always be logged using
a `SceMiEC` structure and `SceMiErrorHandler` function so that an abort sequence is properly handled (see
section 4.3.2.1 on page 62). In addition, the info message can optionally be tagged with a unique
identifying integer specified in the `Id` field.


**4.3.2.3** **Memory Allocation Semantics**
Regarding memory allocation semantics of the SCE-MI API. the following rules apply:

**`•`** _Anything constructed by the user is the user’s responsibility to delete._


**64 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**


**`•`** _Anything constructed by the API is the API’s responsibility to delete._


So this means that any object, such as `SceMiMessageData`, that is created by the application using that
object’s constructor, must be deleted by the application when it is no longer in use. Some objects, such
as `SceMiMessage[In/Out]PortProxy` objects, are constructed by the API then handed over to the
application as pointers. Those objects must not be deleted by the application. Rather, they are deleted
when the entire interface is shut down during the call to `SceMi::ShutDown()` .


Similarly, non-null `SceMiEC` structures that are passed to functions are assumed to be allocated and
deleted by the application. If a NULL `SceMiEC` pointer is passed to a function and an error occurs, the
API allocates the structure to pass to the error handler and therefore is responsible for freeing it.


**4.3.3** **class** `SceMi` **- SCE-MI Software Side Interface**
This is the singleton object that represents the software side of the SCE-MI infrastructure itself.
Operations global to the interface are performed using methods of this class.


**4.3.3.1** **Version Discovery**
```
     static int
     SceMi::Version(
         const char *versionString );

```

This method allows an application to make queries about the version prior to initializing the SCE-MI
that gives it its best chance of specifying a version that it is compatible with. A series of calls can be
made to this function until a compatible version is found. With each call, the application can pass
version numbers corresponding to those it is familiar with and the SCE-MI can respond with a version
handle that is compatible with the queried version. This handle can then be passed onto the initialization
call described in the next section.


If the given version string is not compatible with version of the SCE-MI that the application is
interfacing to, a -1 is returned. At this point, the application has the option of aborting with a fatal error
or attempting other versions that it might also know how to use.


This process is sometimes referred to as _mutual discovery_ .

```
     versionString
```

This argument is of the form `“<majorNum>.<majorNum>.<minorNum>”` and can be obtained by the
application code from the header file of a particular SCE-MI installation.


**4.3.3.2** **Initialization**
```
     static SceMi *
     SceMi::Init(
       int version,
       SceMiParameters *parameters,
       SceMiEC *ec=NULL );

```

This call is the constructor of the SCE-MI interface. It gives access to all the other global methods of the
interface.


The return argument is a pointer to an object of `class SceMi` on which all other methods can be called.


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **65 of 94**


**Formal Functional Specification**

```
           version
```

This input argument is the version number returned by the `::Version()` method described in the
previous section. An error results if the version number is not compatible with the SCE-MI
infrastructure being accessed.

```
           parameters
```

This input argument is a pointer to the parameter block object ( `class SceMiParameters` ) that is
initialized from the parameter file generated by the infrastructure linker. See section 4.3.4 on page 70
for a description of how this object is obtained.


**4.3.3.3** **Shutdown**
```
           static void
           SceMi::Shutdown(
              SceMi *sceMi,
              SceMiEC *ec=NULL );

```

This is the destructor of the SCE-MI infrastructure object that must be called when connection to the
interface is to be terminated. This call is the means by which graceful decoupling of the hardware side
and the software side is achieved. It is also during this call that termination ( `Close()` ) callbacks
registered by the application are called.


**4.3.3.4** **Message Input Port Proxy Binding**
```
           SceMiMessageInPortProxy *
           SceMi::BindMessageInPort(
              const char *transactorName,
              const char *portName,
              const SceMiMessageInPortBinding *binding,
              SceMiEC *ec=NULL );

```

This call searches the list of input ports learned from the parameter file that is generated during
infrastructure linkage for one whose names match the `transactorName` and `portName` arguments. If one
is found, an object of `class SceMiMessageInPortProxy` is constructed to serve as the proxy interface to
that port and the pointer to the constructed object is returned to the caller to serve all future accesses to
that port. It is considered an error if no match is found.

```
           transactorName, portName
```

These arguments uniquely identify a specific message input port in a specific transactor on the hardware
side to which the caller wishes to bind. These names must be the path names (described in 4.2.1 on
page 59) expressed in the syntax of the HDL language that the hardware side bridge netlist is expressed
in.

```
           binding
```

The binding argument is a pointer to an object defined as follows:

```
              struct SceMiMessageInPortBinding {
                void *Context;
                void (*IsReady)(void *context);
                void (*Close)(void *context);
              };

```

whose data members are used for the following:


**66 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**

```
     Context
```

The application is free to use this pointer for any purposes it wishes. Neither `class SceMi` nor `class`

`SceMiMessageInPortProxy` interpret this pointer other than to store it and pass it when calling either the

`IsReady()` or `Close()` callbacks.

```
     IsReady()
```

This is the function pointer for the callback that is to be called whenever an input ready notification has
been received from the hardware side. This call signals that it is okay to send a new message to the input
port. If this pointer is given as a NULL, the SCE-MI assumes that this port does not need to deploy
input ready notification on this particular channel. See 4.1.2.2 on page 48 for a detailed description of
the input ready callback.

```
     Close()
```

This is a termination callback function pointer. It is called during destruction of the SCE-MI. This
pointer can also be optionally specified as NULL.


**4.3.3.5** **Message Output Port Proxy Binding**
```
     SceMiMessageOutPortProxy *
     SceMi::BindMessageOutPort(
       const char *transactorName,
       const char *portName,
       const SceMiMessageOutPortBinding *binding,
       SceMiEC *ec=NULL );

```

This call searches the list of output ports learned from the parameter file that was generated during
infrastructure linkage for one whose names match the `transactorName` and `portName` argument. If one
is found, an object of `class SceMiMessageOutPortProxy` is constructed to serve as the proxy interface
to that port and the handle to the constructed object is returned to the caller to serve all future accesses
to that port. It is considered an error if no match is found.

```
     transactorName, portName
```

These arguments uniquely identify a specific message output port in a specific transactor on the
hardware side to which the caller wishes to bind. These names must be the path names (described in
4.2.1 on page 59) expressed in the syntax of the HDL language that the hardware side bridge netlist is
expressed in.

```
     binding
```

The binding argument is a pointer to an object defined as follows:

```
       struct SceMiMessageOutPortBinding {
         void *Context;
         void (*Receive)(
           void *context,
           const SceMiMessageData *data);
         void (*Close)(void *context);
         };

```

whose data members are used for the following:

```
     Context
```

The application is free to use this pointer for any purposes it wishes. Neither `class SceMi` nor `class`


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **67 of 94**


**Formal Functional Specification**


`SceMiMessageOutPortProxy` interpret this pointer other than to store it and pass it when calling either
the `IsReady()` or `Close()` callbacks.

```
           Receive()
```

This is the function pointer for the receive callback that is to be called whenever an output message
arrives on the port. This callback is required on every output port proxy so it is considered an error if
this function pointer is given as a NULL. See 4.3.7.1 on page 77 for more information about how
receive callbacks process output messages.

```
           Close()
```

This is a termination callback function pointer. It is called during destruction of the SCE-MI. This
pointer can also be optionally specified as NULL.


**4.3.3.6** **Service Loop**
```
           typedef int (*SceMiServiceLoopHandler)( void *context, bool pending );

           int
           SceMi::ServiceLoop(
              SceMiServiceLoopHandler g=NULL,
              void *context=NULL,
              SceMiEC *ec=NULL );

```

This is the main workhorse method that yields CPU processing time to the SCE-MI. In both singlethreaded and multi-threaded environments, calls to this method gives the SCE-MI an opportunity to
service all its port proxies and check for arriving messages or messages that are pending to be sent. It is
also inside this call that the SCE-MI dispatches any input ready or receive callbacks that might be
needed. The underlying transport mechanism that supports the port proxies must respond in a relatively
timely manner to messages enqueued on the input or output port proxies. Since these messages cannot
be handled until a call to `::ServiceLoop()` is made, it is advisable that applications call this function
frequently.


The return argument is the number of output messages that arrived and were processed since the last call
to `::ServiceLoop()` .

```
           g()
```

If `g` is NULL, check for transfers to be performed and dispatch them, returning immediately afterwards.
If `g` is non-NULL, enter a loop of performing transfers and calling `g()` . When `g()` returns 0, return from
the loop. When `g()` is called, an indication of whether there is at least one message pending is made
with the pending flag. The `context` argument to `g()` is the pointer which is passed as the `context`
argument to `::ServiceLoop()` .

```
           context
```

Context argument to be passed to the `g()` function.


**4.3.3.6.1Example of Using the** **`g()`** **Function to Return on Each Call to** **`::ServiceLoop()`**
There are several different ways to use the `g()` function.


Some applications might like to force a return from the `::ServiceLoop()` call after processing each
message. The `::ServiceLoop()` call will always guarantee that a separate call is made to the `g()`


**68 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**


function for each message processed. In fact, it is possible to force `::ServiceLoop()` to return back to
the application once per message by having the `g()` function return a 0.


So even if all `g()` does is return 0 as follows,

```
       int g( void */*context*/, bool /*pending*/ ){ return 0; }

```

the application will forces a return from `::ServiceLoop()` for each processed message.


Note, in this case, the `::ServiceLoop()` will not block because it also returns even if no message was
found (i.e. `pending == 0` ). So basically, `::ServiceLoop()` will return no matter what in this case. No
messages or 1 message.


**4.3.3.6.2Example of Using the** **`g()`** **Function to Block** **`::ServiceLoop()`** **Until Exactly 1 Message**
An application can use the `g()` function to put `::ServiceLoop()` into a blocking mode rather than its
default polling mode. The `g()` function can be written to cause `::ServiceLoop()` to block until it gets
1 message then return on the message it got:


This is done by making use of the `pending` argument to the `g()` function. This argument simply
indicates if there is a message to be processed or not. Here is how it would be written in this case:

```
       int g( void */*context*/, bool pending ){
         return pending == true ? 0 : 1 }

```

What this does it to block until a message occurs then return on processing the first message.


**4.3.3.6.3Example of Using the** **`g()`** **function to Block** **`::ServiceLoop()`** **Until At Least 1 Message**
Alternatively, suppose the application would like `::ServiceLoop()` to block until at least 1 message
occurs, then return only after all the currently pending messages have been processed.


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **69 of 94**


**Formal Functional Specification**


To do this the application can define a `haveProcessedAtLeast1Message` flag as follows:

```
              int haveProcessedAtLeast1Message = 0;

```

Call `::ServiceLoop()` giving the `g()` function and this flag's address as the context:

```
              ...
              haveProcessedAtLeast1Message = 0;
              sceMi->ServiceLoop( g, &haveProcessedAtLeast1Message );
              ...

```

Now define the `g()` function as follows:

```
              int g( void *context, bool pending ){
                int *haveProcessedAtLeast1Message = (int *)context;
                if( pending == 0 )
                  // If no more messages, kick out of loop if at least
                  // one previous message has been processed, otherwise
                  // block until the first message arrives.
                  return *haveProcessedAtLeast1Message ? 0 : 1;
                else {
                  *haveProcessedAtLeast1Message = 1;
                  return 1;
                }
              }

```

In conclusion, depending on precisely what type of operation of `::ServiceLoop()` is desired, the `g()`
function can be tailored accordingly.


**4.3.4** **class** `SceMiParameters` **- Parameter Access**
This class provides a generic API that can be used by application code to access the interface parameter
set described in section 4.2.1 on page 59. It is basically initialized with the contents of the parameter file
that is generated during infrastructure linkage. It provides accessors that facilitate the reading and
possibly overriding of parameters and their values. All SCE-MI required parameters are read-only
because their values are automatically determined by the infrastructure linker by analyzing the user
supplied netlist. Implementation specific parameters can be read-only or read-write as required by the
implementation. All parameters in a `SceMiParameters` object must be overridden before that object is
passed to the `SceMi::Init()` call to construct the interface (see 4.3.3.2 on page 65). Overriding
parameters afterwards has no effect.


**4.3.4.1** **Parameter Set**
While the format of the parameter file is implementation specific, the set of parameters required by the
SCE-API and the methods used to access them must conform to the specifications described in this
section. For purposes of access, the parameter set shall be organized as a database of _attributed objects_,
where each object instance is decorated with a set of attributes expressed as name/value pairs. There can
be zero or more instances of each object kind. The API shall provide a simple accessor to return the
number of objects of a given kind, and read and write accessors (described below) to allow reading or
overriding attribute values of specific objects.


The objects in the database are composed of the set of necessary interfacing components that interface
the SCE-MI infrastructure to the application. For example, there is a distinct object instance for each
message port and a distinct object instance representing each defined clock in the system. Attributes of
each of the objects then represent, collectively, the parameters that uniquely characterize the dimensions
and constitution of the interface components needed for a particular application.


**70 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**


So, for example, a system that requires 1 input port, 2 output ports and 2 distinct clocks is represented
with 5 objects parametrized such that each port object has name and width attributes, each clock object
has ratio, duty cycle attributes, etc. These objects and their attributes precisely and fully describe the
interfacing requirements between that application and the SCE-MI infrastructure.


The following table gives the minimal, predefined set of objects and attributes required by the SCE-MI.
Additional objects and attributes can be added by implementations. For example, there may be a single,
implementation specific object representing the entire SCE-MI infrastructure facility itself. The
attributes of this singleton object might be the set of implementation specific parameters that an
implementor of the SCE-MI needs to allow the user to specify. For more details of attribute meanings,
see section 4.2.1 on page 59.

`ClockBinding` `TransactorName` String Name of the transactor that contributes to the
control of this clock.


`ClockName` String Name of the clock that this transactor helps control.


For simplicity, values can be either signed integer or string values. More complex data types can be
derived by the application code from string values. Each attribute definition of each object kind implies
a specific value type.


**4.3.4.2** **Parameter Set Semantics**
Although the accessors provided by the `SceMiParameters` class directly provide the information given
in the above table, other implied parameters can be easily derived by the application. Following are
some of the implied parameters and how they are determined:


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **71 of 94**


**Formal Functional Specification**




**`•`** `ClockBinding` objects indicate the total number of transactor - clock control macro combinations.
From the `ClockBinding` objects, one can ascertain the number of distinct contributors to the control
of a given clock, as well as the number of distinct transactors in the system.

**`•`** The number of transactors in the system is determined by counting the number of distinct



`TransactorName’s` encountered in the `ClockBinding` objects.

**`•`** The number of controlled clocks is determined by reading the number of `Clock` objects (using the



`::NumberOfObjects()` accessor described below).

**`•`** The number of input and output ports are determined by reading the number of `MessageInPort` and



`MessageOutPort` objects, respectively.



In addition, the following semantics characterize the parameter set:

**`•`** Transactor names are absolute hierarchical path names, and must conform to the syntax of the HDL
language that the bridge netlist is expressed in.

**`•`** Port names are relative hierarchical path names (relative to the enclosing transactor), and must
conform to the syntax of the HDL language that the bridge netlist is expressed in.

**`•`** Clock names are identifiers, not path names, and must conform to identifier naming syntax of the
HDL language that the bridge netlist is expressed in.


**4.3.4.3** **Constructor**
```
           SceMiParameters::SceMiParameters(
              const char *paramsFile,
              SceMiEC *ec=NULL );

```

The constructor constructs an object containing all the default values of parameters and then overrides
them with any settings it finds in the specified parameter file. All parameters, whether specified by the
user or not must have default values. Once constructed, parameters can be further overridden
procedurally.

```
           paramsFile
```

This is the name of the file generated by the infrastructure linker that contains all the parameters derived
from the user’s hardware side netlist. This name can be either a full pathname to a file or pathname
relative to the local directory.


**4.3.4.4** **Destructor**
```
           SceMiParameters::~SceMiParameters()

```

This is the destructor for the parameters object.


**72 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**


**4.3.4.5** **Accessors**
```
     unsigned int
     SceMiParameters::NumberOfObjects(
       const char *objectKind,
       SceMiEC *ec=NULL ) const;

```

This accessor returns the number of instances of objects of the specified `objectKind` name.

```
     int
     SceMiParameters::AttributeIntegerValue(
       const char *objectKind,
       unsigned int index,
       const char *attributeName,
       SceMiEC *ec=NULL ) const;

     const char *
     SceMiParameters::AttributeStringValue(
       const char *objectKind,
       unsigned int index,
       const char *attributeName,
       SceMiEC *ec=NULL ) const;

```

These two accessors read return an integer or string attribute value.

```
     void
     SceMiParameters::OverrideAttributeIntegerValue(
       const char *objectKind,
       unsigned int index,
       const char *attributeName,
       int value,
       SceMiEC *ec=NULL );

     void
     SceMiParameters::OverrideAttributeStringValue(
       const char *objectKind,
       unsigned int index,
       const char *attributeName,
       const char *value,
       SceMiEC *ec=NULL );

```

These two accessors override an integer or string attribute value. It is considered an error to attempt to
override any of the object attributes shown in the table in section 4.3.4.1 on page 70 or any
implementation specific attributes designated as read-only.


The following argument descriptions generally apply to all the accessors shown above:

```
     objectKind
```

Name of the kind of object for which an attribute value is being accessed. It is considered an error to
pass an unrecognized `objectKind` name to any of the accessors.

```
     index
```

Index of the instance of the object for which an attribute value is being accessed. It is considered an
error if the `index` >= the number returned by the `::NumberOfObjects()` accessor.


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **73 of 94**


**Formal Functional Specification**

```
    attributeName
```

Name of the attribute whose value is being read or overwritten. It is considered an error if the

`attributeName` does not identify one of the attributes allowed for the given `objectKind` .

```
    value
```

Returned or passed in `value` of the attribute being read or overridden respectively. Two overloaded
variants of each accessor are provided. One for string values and one for integer values.


**4.3.5** **class** `SceMiMessageData` **- Message Data Object**
The `class SceMiMessageData` represents the vector of message data that can be transferred from a

`SceMiMessageInPortProxy` on the software side to its associated `SceMiMessageOutPort` on the
hardware side, or from a `SceMiMessageOutPort` on the hardware side to its associated

`SceMiMessageOutPortProxy` on the software side. The message data payload is represented as a fixed
length array of `SceMiU32` data words large enough to contain the bit vector being transferred to or from
the hardware side message port. For example if the message port had a width of 72 bits, the following
diagram shows how the those bits would be organized in the data array contained inside the

`SceMiMessageData` object:

```
       SceMiMessage[In/Out]Port.Message[] bits:

```



```
SceMiMessageData word 0
SceMiMessageData word 1
SceMiMessageData word 2

```


**4.3.5.1** **Constructor**
```
           SceMiMessageData::SceMiMessageData(
              const SceMiMessageInPortProxy &messageInPortProxy,
              SceMiEC *ec=NULL );

```

Construct a message data object whose size matches the width of the specified input port. The
constructed message data object can only be used for sends on that port (or another of identical size) or
an error will result.


**4.3.5.2** **Destructor**
```
           SceMiMessageData::~SceMiMessageData()

```

Destruct the object, free data array.


**74 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**


**4.3.5.3** **Accessors**
```
     unsigned int
     SceMiMessageData::WidthInBits() const;

```

Return the width of the message in terms of number of bits.

```
     unsigned int
     SceMiMessageData::WidthInWords() const;

```

Return the size of the data array in terms of number of `SceMiU32` words.

```
     void
     SceMiMessageData::Set( unsigned int i, SceMiU32 word, SceMiEC *ec = NULL );

```

Set word element i of array to word.

```
     void
     SceMiMessageData::SetBit( unsigned int i, int bit, SceMiEC *ec = NULL );

```

Set bit element `i` of the message vector to 0 if `bit == 0`, 1 otherwise. It is an error if `i` >=
```
     ::WidthInBits().

     void
     SceMiMessageData::SetBitRange(
     unsigned int i, unsigned int range, SceMiU32 bits, SceMiEC *ec = NULL );

```

Set `range` bit elements whose LSB’s start at bit element `i` of the message vector to the value of `bits` . It
is an error if `i+range` >= `::WidthInBits().`

```
     SceMiU32
     SceMiMessageData::Get( unsigned int i, SceMiEC *ec = NULL ) const;

```

Return the word at slot `i` in the array. It is an error if `i` >= `::WidthInWords()` .

```
     int
     SceMiMessageData::GetBit( unsigned int i, SceMiEC *ec = NULL ) const;

```

Return the value of bit element `i` in the message vector. It is an error if `i` >= `::WidthInBits()` .

```
     SceMiU32
     SceMiMessageData::GetBitRange( unsigned int i, unsigned int range, SceMiEC *ec = NULL )
     const;

```

Return the value of `range` bit elements whose LSB’s start at `i` of the message vector. It is an error if

`i+range` >= `::WidthInBits()` .

```
     SceMiU64
     SceMiMessageData::CycleStamp() const;

```

The SCE-MI supports a feature called _cycle stamping_ . Each output message sent to the software side is
stamped with the number of cycles of the 1/1 controlled clock elapsed since the beginning of emulation
time. This provides a convenient way for applications to keep track of elapsed cycles in their respective
transactors as the simulation proceeds. The returned value is an absolute, 64-bit unsigned quantity.


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **75 of 94**


**Formal Functional Specification**


**4.3.6** **class** `SceMiMessageInPortProxy`
The `class SceMiMessageInPortProxy` presents to the application a proxy interface to a transactor
message input port.


**4.3.6.1** **Sending Input Messages**
```
           void
           SceMiMessageInPortProxy::Send(
              const SceMiMessageData &data,
              SceMiEC *ec=NULL );

```

This method sends a message to the message input channel. This message appears on the hardware side
as a bit vector presented to the transactor via the `SceMiMessageInPort` macro (see 4.1.2 on page 47)
instance bound to this proxy.


**data**
Message data object containing the message to be sent.


**4.3.6.2** **Replacing Port Binding**
```
           void ReplaceBinding(
              const SceMiMessageInPortBinding* binding,
              SceMiEC* ec=NULL );

```

This method replaces the `SceMiMessageInPortBinding` object originally furnished to the

`SceMi::BindMessageInPortProxy()` call that created this port proxy object (see 4.3.3.4 on page 66).
This can be useful for replacing contexts or input ready callback functions some time after the input
message port proxy has been established.


**binding**
New callback and context information to be associated with this message input port proxy.


**4.3.6.3** **Accessors**
```
           const char *
           SceMiMessageInPortProxy::TransactorName() const;

```

This method returns the name of the transactor that is connected to the port. This is the absolute
hierarchical path name to the transactor instance expressed in the syntax of HDL language that the
netlist is expressed in.

```
           const char *
           SceMiMessageInPortProxy::PortName() const;

```

This method returns the port name. This is the path name to the `SceMiMessageInPort` macro instance
relative to the containing transactor expressed in the syntax of HDL language that the netlist is
expressed in.

```
           unsigned
           SceMiMessageInPortProxy::PortWidth() const;

```

This method returns the port width. This is the value of the `PortWidth` parameter that was passed to the
associated `SceMiMessageInPort` instance on the hardware side.


**76 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**


**4.3.6.4** **Destructor**
There is no public destructor for this class. Destruction of all message input ports shall automatically
occur when the `SceMi::ShutDown()` function is called.


**4.3.7** **class** `SceMiMessageOutPortProxy`
The `class MessageOutPortProxy` presents to the application a proxy interface to the transactor
message output port.


**4.3.7.1** **Receiving Output Messages**
There are no methods on this object specifically for reading messages that arrive on the output port
proxy. Rather, that operation is handled by the receive callbacks. Receive callbacks are registered with
an output port proxy when it is first bound to the channel (see 4.3.3.5 on page 67). The prototype for the
receive callback is as follows:

```
       void (*Receive)( void *context, const SceMiMessageData *data );

```

When called, the receive callback is passed a pointer to a `class SceMiMessageData` object (see section
4.2.1.1 on page 61) that contains the content of the received message. It is also passed the context
pointer. The context pointer is typically a pointer to the object representing the software model that is
interfacing to the port proxy. Proper usage of this callback is to process the data quickly and return as
soon as possible. The reference to the `SceMiMessageData` is of limited lifetime and ceases to exist once
the callback returns and goes out of scope.


Typically in a SystemC context, the callback might do some minor manipulation to the context object
then immediately return and let a suspended thread resume and do the main processing of the received
transaction.


Notice that no `SceMiEC *` error status object is passed to the call. This is because if an error occurs
within the `SceMi::ServiceLoop()` function (from which the receive callback is normally called), the
callback is never called in the first place and standard error handling procedures (see 4.3.2.1 on page 62)
are followed by the service loop function itself. If an error occurs inside the receive callback, by
implication it is an application error not an SCE-MI error and thus it is the responsibility of the
application to handle the error by perhaps setting a flag in the context object before returning from the
callback.


**4.3.7.2** **Replacing Port Binding**
```
     void ReplaceBinding(
       const SceMiMessageOutPortBinding* binding,
       SceMiEC* ec=NULL );

```

This method replaces the `SceMiMessageOutPortBinding` object originally furnished to the

`SceMi::BindMessageOutPortProxy()` call that created this port proxy object (see 4.3.3.5 on page 67).
This can be useful for replacing contexts or receive callback functions some time after the output
message port proxy has been established.


**binding**
New callback and context information to be associated with this message output port proxy.


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **77 of 94**


**Formal Functional Specification**


**4.3.7.3** **Accessors**
```
           const char *
           SceMiMessageOutPortProxy::TransactorName() const;

```

This method returns the name of the transactor that is connected to the port. This is the absolute
hierarchical path name to the transactor instance expressed in the syntax of HDL language that the
netlist is expressed in.

```
           const char *
           SceMiMessageOutPortProxy::PortName() const;

```

This method returns the port name. This is the path name to the `SceMiMessageOutPort` macro instance
relative to the containing transactor expressed in the syntax of HDL language that the netlist is
expressed in.

```
           unsigned
           SceMiMessageOutPortProxy::PortWidth() const;

```

This method returns the port width. This is the value of the `PortWidth` parameter that was passed to the
associated `SceMiMessageOutPort` instance on the hardware side.


**4.3.7.4** **Destructor**
There is no public destructor for this class. Destruction of all message output ports shall automatically
occur when the `SceMi::ShutDown()` function is called.


**4.4 Software Side Interface - C API**

The SCI-MI software side also provides an ANSI standard C API. All of the subsections to follow will
parallel those in the C++ API described starting in section 4.3 on page 61. It is possible to implement
the C API as functions that wrap calls to methods described in the C++ API. The prototypes of those
functions shall follow with a minimum of explanatory text. For full documentation about a function, see
its corresponding subsection of section 4.3 on page 61.


**78 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**


**4.4.1** **Primitive Data Types**
The C API has its own header file with the following minimum content:

```
    typedef unsigned SceMiU32;
    typedef unsigned long long SceMiU64;

    typedef void SceMi;
    typedef void SceMiParameters;
    typedef void SceMiMessageData;
    typedef void SceMiMessageInPortProxy;
    typedef void SceMiMessageOutPortProxy;

    typedef int (*ServiceLoopHandler)( void *context, int pending );

    typedef enum {
      SceMiOK,
      SceMiError,
    } SceMiErrorType;
    typedef struct {
      const char *Culprit;
      const char *Message;
      SceMiErrorType Type;
      int Id;
    } SceMiEC;
    typedef void (*SceMiErrorHandler)(void *context, SceMiEC *ec);

    typedef enum {
      SceMiInfo,
      SceMiWarning
    } SceMiInfoType;
    typedef struct {
      const char *Culprit;
      const char *Message;
      SceMiInfoType Type;
      int Id;
    } SceMiIC;
    typedef void (*SceMiInfoHandler)(void *context, SceMiIC *ic);

    typedef struct {
      void *Context;
      void (*IsReady)(void *context);
      void (*Close)(void *context);
    } SceMiMessageInPortBinding;
    typedef struct {
      void *Context;
      void (*Receive)(
        void *context,
        const SceMiMessageData *data );
      void (*Close)(void *context);
    } SceMiMessageOutPortBinding;

```

An application must include either the C API header or the C++ API header, but not both.


Note that because ANSI C does not support default argument values, the last `SceMiEC *ec` argument to
each function must be explicitly passed when called, even if only to pass a NULL.

**Formal Functional Specification**


**Appendix A:** **Glossary**


**Abstraction Bridge**
A collection of _abstraction gasket_ components that disguise a bus cycle accurate (BCA) RTL
DUT model as a purely untimed model. The idea is that to the untimed testbench models, the
DUT itself appears untimed (see Figure 2 on page 9) when, in fact, it is a disguised BCA
model (see Figure 3 on page 11).


**Abstraction Gasket**
A special model that can change the level of abstraction of data flowing from its input to output
and vice versa. For example, an abstraction gasket might convert an untimed transaction to a
series of cycle accurate events. Or it might assemble a series of events into a single message.
Examples of abstraction gaskets are CoWare or SystemC _BCASH models_, and Ikos
_transactors_ .


**Behavioral Model**
See definition for _untimed model_ .


**Bridge Netlist**
The _bridge netlist_ is the top level of the user supplied netlist of components making up the
_hardware side_ of a co-modeling process. The components typically found instantiated
immediately under the _bridge netlist_ are _transactors_, _DUT_, and `SceMiClockPort` macros. By
convention, the top level netlist module supplied by the user to the _infrastructure linker_ is often
called `Bridge` and, for Verilog, is placed in a file called `Bridge.v` .


**Co-Emulation**
A shorthand notation for _co-emulation modeling_ also known as _co-modeling_ . See definition for
_co-modeling_ .


**Co-Modeling**
Although it has broader meanings outside this document, within this document co-modeling
specifically refers to _transaction oriented co-modeling_ in contrast to a broader definition of comodeling that might include _event oriented co-modeling_ . Also known as _co-emulation_
_modeling,_ transaction oriented co-modeling describes the process of modeling and simulating
a mixture of software models represented with an _untimed_ level of abstraction, simultaneously
executing and inter-communicating through an _abstraction bridge_, with hardware models
represented with the _RTL_ level of abstraction, running on an emulator. The following diagram
depicts such a configuration where the SCE-MI is being used as the abstraction bridge. See


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **85 of 94**


**Formal Functional Specification**


section 1.4 on page 3 for meanings of acronyms. Another illustration can be seen in Figure 1
on page 6.

**Controlled Clock (cclock)**
The clock that drives the DUT and can be disabled by any transactor during operations that
would result in erroneous operation of the DUT if it is clocked. When performing such
operations, any transactor can “freeze” _controlled time_ long enough to complete the operation
before allowing clocking of the DUT to resume. The term _cclock_ is often used throughout this
document as a synonym for _controlled clock_ .


**Controlled Time**
Time which is advanced by the _controlled clock_ and frozen when the _controlled clock_ is
suspended by one or more transactors. Operations occurring in _uncontrolled time_ while
controlled time is frozen appear between _controlled clock_ cycles.


**Co-Simulation**
Execution of software models modeled with different levels of abstraction that interact with
each other through _abstraction gaskets_ similar to CoWare’s BCASH models. The following
diagram illustrates such a configuration. See section 1.4 on page 3 for meanings of acronyms.
The key difference between co-simulation and co-emulation is that the former typically
couples software models to a traditional HDL simulator interface through a proprietary API
whereas the latter couples software models to an emulator through an optimized transaction
oriented message passing interface such as SCE-MI.

**Formal Functional Specification**


**Cycle Stamping**
A process by which messages are tagged with the number of elapsed counts of the fastest
controlled clock in the hardware side of a co-modeled design.


**Don’t Care Duty Cycle**
A _posedge active don’t care duty cycle_ is a way of specifying a duty cycle where the user only
cares about the posedge of the clock and does not care about where in the period the negedge
falls, particularly in relation to other cclocks in a functional simulation. In such a case, the

`DutyHi` parameter is given as a 0. The `DutyLo` can be given as an arbitrary number of units that
represent the whole period such that the `Phase` offset can still be expressed as a percentage of
the period (i.e. `DutyHi` + `DutyLo` ). See 4.1.4.1 on page 52 for more details.


A _negedge active don’t care duty cycle_ is a way of specifying a duty cycle where the user only
cares about the negedge of the clock and does not care about where in the period the posedge
falls, particularly in relation to other cclocks in a functional simulation. In such a case, the

represent the whole period such that the `Phase` offset can still be expressed as a percentage of
the period (i.e. `DutyHi` + `DutyLo` ). See 4.1.4.1 on page 52 for more details.


**DUT**
Device or Design Under Test that might be modeled in hardware and stimulated and responded
to by a software testbench through an _abstraction bridge_ such as the SCE-MI.

**DUT Proxy**
Software model which acts as a “socket” that disguises an _abstraction bridge_ to look to the rest
of a software testbench like an untimed DUT model. If the abstraction bridge is the SCE-MI,
the job of the DUT proxy is to encapsulate the _message port proxy_ interfaces to the message
channels in the interface. See Figure 3 on page 11 for an illustration of DUT proxies.


**Hardware Model**
Model of a block that has a structural representation (i.e., as a result of synthesis or a gate
netlist generated by an appropriate tool) that is mapped onto the _hardware side_ of a comodeling process (i.e., an emulator or other hardware simulation platform). It could also be
real silicon (i.e., a CPU core or memory chip) plugged into an emulator or simulation
accelerator.


**Hardware Side**
See definition for _software side_ .


**Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)** **87 of 94**


**Formal Functional Specification**


**Infrastructure Linkage Process**
The process that reads a user description of the hardware, namely the source or _bridge_ netlist
that describes the interconnect between the transactors, the DUT, and the SCE-MI interface
components, and compiles that netlist into a form suitable for executing in a co-modeling
session. Part of this compile process can involve adding additional structure to the bridge
netlist that properly interfaces the user supplied netlist to the SCE-MI infrastructure
implementation components.


**Macros**
Implementation components provided by the hardware emulator vendor to implement the
hardware side of the SCE-MI infrastructure. The required macros as defined in this
specification are the `SceMiMessageInPort`, `SceMiMessageOutPort`,
`SceMiClockControl`, and `SceMiClockPort` macros.


**Message**
A unit of data of arbitrary size and abstraction to be transported over a channel. Messages are
generally not associated with specific clocked events but may trigger or result from, many
clocks of event activity. Note that, for the most part, the term _message_ can be used
interchangeably with _transaction_ . However, in some contexts, _transaction_ could be thought of
as including infrastructure overhead content in addition to user payload data (and handled at a
lower layer of the interface) whereas the term _message_ denotes only user payload data.


**Message Channel**
A two ended conduit of messages between the software and hardware sides of an _abstraction_
_bridge_ .


**Message Port**
The _hardware side_ end of a _message channel_ . A message port is the means by which
_transactors_ gain access to messages being sent across the channel to or from the _software side_ .


**Message Port Proxy**
The _software side_ end of a _message channel_ . A message port proxy is the means by which
_DUT proxies_ or other software models gain access to messages being sent across the channel to
or from the _hardware side_ .


**Negedge**
See definition for _posedge_ .


**Posedge**
Although this is a Verilog specific term that refers to the rising edge of a clock, it is used
generically throughout this document to refer to the same thing. The same applies to _negedge_
referring to the falling edge of a clock.


**Service Loop**
This is the method that provides a means for a set of software models running on a host
workstation to yield access to the SCE-MI software side so that any pending input or output
messages on the channels can be serviced. This method should be called frequently by the
software, throughout the co-modeling session in order to avoid backup of messages and
minimize the possibility of system deadlock. In multi-threaded environments, it makes sense to
place the service loop call in its own continually running thread.


**Software Model**
Model of a block (hardware or software) that is simulated on the _software side_ of a co

**88 of 94** **Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)**


**Formal Functional Specification**


modeling session (i.e., the host workstation). Such a model can be an algorithm (C or C++)
running on an ISS or a hardware model that is modeled using an appropriate language
environment such as CoWare, SystemC, or an HDL simulator.


**Software Side**
This term refers to the portion of a user’s design which, during a co-modeling session, runs on
the host workstation as opposed to the portion running on the emulator which is referred to as
the _hardware side_ . The SCE-MI infrastructure itself is also considered to have _software side_
and _hardware side_ components.


**Structural Model**
A netlist of _hardware models_ or other _structural models_ . Because this definition is recursive, it
is implied that structural models have hierarchy.


**Transaction**
See definition for _message_ .


**Transactor**
A form of _abstraction gasket_ . The job of a transactor is to decompose an untimed transaction
to a series of cycle accurate clocked events, or, conversely, to compose a series of clocked
events into a single message. When receiving messages, transactors have the ability to “freeze”
_controlled time_ long enough to allow message decomposition operations to complete before
presenting clocked data to a DUT. And when sending messages, they can freeze controlled
time and allow message composition operations to complete before new clocked data is
flooded in from a DUT.


**Uncontrolled Clock (uclock)**
Free running system clock internally generated by the SCE-MI infrastructure used only within
_transactor_ modules to advance states in _uncontrolled time_ . The term _uclock_ is often used
throughout this document as a synonym for _uncontrolled clock_ .


**Uncontrolled Reset**
This is the system reset internally generated by the SCE-MI infrastructure and used only with
transactor modules. This signal is high at the beginning of simulated time and transitions to a
low an arbitrary (implementation dependent) number of uclocks later. It can be used to reset a
transactor. The controlled reset is generated exactly once by the SCE-MI hardware side
infrastructure at the very beginning of a co-modeling session.


**Uncontrolled Time**
Time that is advanced by the _uncontrolled clock_ even when the _controlled clock_ is suspended
(and _controlled time_ is frozen).


**Untimed Model**
A block that is modeled algorithmically at the functional level and exchanges data with other
models in the form of messages. An untimed model has no notion of a clock. Rather, its
operation is triggered by arriving messages and can, in turn, trigger operations in other untimed
models by sending messages.

This design demonstrates the following points:

**`•`** Three `ClockPort` instances define clocks named `cclock`, `cclock2_1`, and `cclock4_1.`

**`•`** Because no parameters are given with the `SceMiClockPort` instance `cclock`, all default parameters
are used. This means that `cclock` has a `ClockNum=1`, a clock ratio of 1/1, a _don’t care duty cycle_, a

**Formal Functional Specification**


phase shift of 0, and the controlled reset it supplies has an active duration of 8 controlled clock
cycles.

**`•`** The `cclock2_1` instance of `SceMiClockPort` overrides the first three parameters and leaves the rest
at their default values. This means the `cclock2_1` has a `ClockNum=2`, a clock ratio of 2/1 (i.e., a
“divide-by-2” clock), a duty cycle of 50%, a phase shift of 0, and an 8 clock cycle reset duration.

**`•`** The `cclock4_1` instance of `SceMiClockPort` has a `ClockNum=3`, a clock ratio of 4/1 (i.e., a “divideby-4” clock), a duty cycle of 75%, a phase shift of 30% of the clock period, and an 8 clock cycle
reset duration.

**`•`** The `TxTransactor` transactor model, named `Bridge.u1`, controls clocks `cclock` and `cclock2_1`
since its `SceMiClockControl` macro instances have `ClockNum=1` and `ClockNum=2`, respectively.

**`•`** This `TxTransactor` model interfaces to a message input port called `p1` that is parametrized to a
bit-width of 64.

**`•`** The `RxTransactor` transactor model, named `Bridge.u2`, controls clock `cclock4_1` since its

`SceMiClockControl` macro instance has `ClockNum=3` .

**`•`** This `RxTransactor` model interfaces to a message input port called `p1` that is parametrized to a
bit-width of 128.
