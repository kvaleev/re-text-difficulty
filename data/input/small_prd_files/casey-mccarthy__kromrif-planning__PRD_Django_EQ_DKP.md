# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# EQ DKP Plus Django + DRF Migration

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the existing EQ DKP Plus PHP application to a modern Django + Django REST Framework (DRF) based backend. The new system will serve as the **authoritative source of truth** for guild roster management, integrating with Discord bot services for automated role management. The system will include comprehensive character tracking, DKP point accrual, events/raids management, loot distribution tracking, and a recruitment application system for prospective guild members.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Current System Analysis
The existing EQ DKP Plus system is a comprehensive PHP-based application that manages:
- User accounts and authentication
- Guild member/character roster
- DKP point tracking with single pool system
- Event and raid management
- Item distribution and point expenditure
- Complex point adjustment and calculation systems

### 2.2 Migration Scope
The Django + DRF migration will implement core functionality for:
- **Authoritative guild roster management** (primary source of truth)
- **Discord bot integration** for automated role synchronization
- **Recruitment application system** with approval workflows
- Character association with users
- Point accrual tracking
- Events (raid types) management
- Raids (instances of events with point awards)
- Item drops and point expenditures

### 2.3 System Authority and Integration
This system will serve as the **single source of truth** for:
- Guild membership status and roles
- Character roster and rank assignments
- Member status changes (promotions, demotions, removals)
- Discord role synchronization data

### 2.4 Point Allocation Architecture
**Fundamental Design**: Points are awarded to **Discord users** (not characters) with a single DKP pool system to enable flexible character reassignment:
- Single DKP pool for all guild activities (no multiple pools)
- Raid attendance data parsed by character names
- Points awarded to the Django User account owning that character
- Characters can be reassigned between users without point transfer complexity
- Simplified queries and reduced data complexity
- Support for extended player breaks with character transfers

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 User Management

- Session management using Django's built-in session framework + allauth integration
- **API Key System for programmatic access:**
  - Django REST Framework Token Authentication linked to allauth accounts
  - Personal API keys automatically generated from allauth Discord accounts
  - Bot API keys for Discord bots (admin-generated with extended permissions)
  - Scoped permissions based on Django groups and role_group field
  - Rate limiting per API key type via Django middleware

#### 3.1.2 User Profiles (Extended Django User Model)

  - Discord ID (unique identifier, populated from allauth SocialAccount)
  - Discord username and discriminator (from allauth extra_data)
  - Discord avatar URL (from allauth extra_data)
  - Discord email (from OAuth scope, stored in User.email)
- **Role Group System (single CharField with choices):**
  - developer, officer, recruiter, member, applicant, guest (in order of highest to lowest permissions)
  - Single role group per user (hierarchical permissions via Django groups)
- **API Key Management via DRF Token + allauth integration:**
  - Personal API keys automatically generated when Discord account is linked

- Security audit passed via Django security checklist
- Documentation complete via Django admin docs
- Code review standards met via Django coding standards

## 14. Django-Specific Implementation Details

### 14.1 Django Architecture Decisions
- **Extended Django User Model** instead of separate profile model for better allauth integration
- **Django-allauth** for Discord OAuth with automatic token management and refresh
- **Django Groups + role_group field** for hierarchical permission system
- **Django Signals** for automatic point summary updates and allauth data synchronization
- **DRF Token Authentication linked to allauth** for API access with automatic token generation
- **Custom allauth adapter** to populate User model from Discord OAuth data
- **Django Admin Actions** for bulk operations and administrative workflows
- **Django Management Commands** for data migration and maintenance tasks

### 14.2 Django Security Implementation
- **Django-allauth** for secure Discord OAuth 2.0 integration with automatic token refresh
- **DRF Permission Classes** for role-based API access control
- **Django Middleware** for rate limiting and API key authentication
- **Django Validators** for input validation and data integrity
- **Django CSRF Protection** for web interface security
- **Django Secret Key Management** for production security
- **Allauth Security Features** including automatic token validation and refresh

### 14.3 Django Performance Optimizations
- **Django Query Optimization** with select_related and prefetch_related
- **Django Caching Framework** with Redis backend for frequent queries
- **Django Database Indexes** via Model Meta for optimized lookups
- **Django Connection Pooling** for efficient database connections
- **Django Static File Handling** via WhiteNoise or CDN for production

### 14.4 Django Testing Strategy
- **Django TestCase** for model and view testing
- **DRF APITestCase** for API endpoint testing
- **Django TransactionTestCase** for testing database transactions
- **Django Mock** for external service integration testing
- **Django Fixtures or Factory Boy** for test data generation

This Django implementation maintains the same business logic and data relationships as the FastAPI version while leveraging Django's built-in features, django-allauth for Discord integration, admin interface, ORM capabilities, and the Django REST Framework for API development. The architecture takes advantage of Django's batteries-included philosophy and allauth's robust OAuth handling while maintaining the flexibility needed for Discord bot integration and complex guild management workflows.
