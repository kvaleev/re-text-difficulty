# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Self-Improving Agent (SIA)

## 1. Document Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This PRD outlines the requirements for building a Self-Improving Agent (SIA), an autonomous AI system designed to evolve over time through self-analysis, memory management, and code generation. The SIA will maintain long-term memory for knowledge retention and retrieval, analyze its own tools and codebase for optimization opportunities, generate new features or improvements, and integrate them via Git pull requests (PRs). This agent aims to reduce human intervention in AI maintenance and enhancement, fostering a cycle of continuous improvement.

### 1.2 Scope
- **In Scope**: Core architecture for memory, self-analysis, code generation, and Git integration; basic UI/CLI for monitoring; initial set of tools for the agent.
- **Out of Scope**: Advanced security hardening beyond basic authentication; multi-agent collaboration; deployment to production environments without human review; ethical AI governance frameworks (to be addressed in a separate ethics addendum).

### 1.3 Target Audience
- Developers and AI researchers building self-evolving systems.
- Organizations seeking automated AI maintenance.
- End-users interacting with the agent for tasks, who benefit indirectly from its improvements.

### 1.4 Assumptions
- The agent runs in a controlled environment (e.g., Docker container) with access to Git repositories.
- Integration with external services (e.g., GitHub API) requires API keys provided by the user.
- The agent uses open-source LLMs (e.g., via Hugging Face) or proprietary models (e.g., Grok API) for reasoning and code generation.

### 1.5 Definitions
- **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**: Persistent storage for facts, experiences, and learned patterns.
- **Self-Analysis**: Introspection of the agent's tools, codebase, and performance metrics.
- **Code Generation**: Automated creation of new code snippets, features, or bug fixes.
- **Git Pull Request (PR)**: A proposed change submitted to a repository for review and merge.

## 2. Business Goals and Objectives

### 2.1 Goals
- Enable the agent to autonomously identify and resolve inefficiencies in its operation.
- Reduce development cycles by automating feature enhancements.
- Provide a scalable framework for AI agents to adapt to new tasks without manual reprogramming.

### 2.2 Success Metrics
- **Quantitative**: 80% of generated PRs are mergeable without major revisions (measured over 50 iterations); memory retrieval accuracy >95% on benchmark queries; self-analysis cycle time <5 minutes.
- **Qualitative**: User feedback scores >4/5 on ease of monitoring improvements; demonstrable evolution (e.g., agent handles 20% more complex tasks after 10 self-improvement cycles).

## 3. User Stories and Use Cases

### 3.1 User Personas
- **AI Developer (Primary)**: Wants to deploy the SIA for task automation and observe its self-evolution.
- **System Administrator**: Monitors the agent's PRs and ensures safe integrations.
- **End-User**: Interacts with the agent for queries/tasks, unaware of backend improvements.

### 3.2 Key User Stories
1. As an AI Developer, I want the SIA to store task outcomes in LTM so that it can recall and learn from past experiences.
2. As an AI Developer, I want the SIA to retrieve relevant memories during task execution to improve decision-making.
3. As a System Administrator, I want the SIA to analyze its tools and codebase periodically to identify bottlenecks or outdated components.
4. As an AI Developer, I want the SIA to generate code for new features based on self-analysis results.
5. As a System Administrator, I want the SIA to submit improvements as Git PRs for human review before integration.
6. As an End-User, I want the SIA to handle increasingly complex queries over time without degradation in performance.

### 3.3 Use Cases
- **Use Case 1: Memory Management**
  - Preconditions: Agent completes a task (e.g., data analysis).
  - Flow: Agent embeds task details into LTM; on future similar tasks, retrieves and applies relevant memories.
  - Postconditions: Improved task efficiency (e.g., 30% faster resolution).

- **Use Case 2: Self-Analysis**
  - Preconditions: Scheduled trigger or performance threshold breach.
  - Flow: Agent scans codebase and tools; identifies issues (e.g., inefficient algorithm); logs analysis report.
  - Postconditions: Report available for review; basis for code generation.

- **Use Case 3: Code Generation and PR Submission**
  - Preconditions: Analysis identifies improvement opportunity.
  - Flow: Agent generates code; tests it locally; creates a branch, commits changes, and submits PR via Git API.
  - Postconditions: PR pending review; agent pauses related self-improvements until merge.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Core Components
The SIA architecture includes:
- **Memory Module**: Handles LTM storage and retrieval.
- **Analysis Module**: Performs introspection on tools/codebase.
- **Generation Module**: Creates new code/features.
- **Integration Module**: Manages Git interactions.
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates modules and task execution.

### 4.2 Detailed Requirements

#### 4.2.1 Long-Term Memory and Retrieval
- **FR1.1**: Implement a vector database (e.g., FAISS or Pinecone) for embedding-based storage of memories (text, code snippets, task logs).
- **FR1.2**: Support embedding generation using models like Sentence Transformers or LLM APIs.
- **FR1.3**: Retrieval mechanism: Semantic search with cosine similarity; hybrid keyword + semantic for accuracy.
- **FR1.4**: Memory types: Episodic (task-specific), Semantic (general knowledge), Procedural (code patterns).
- **FR1.5**: Forgetting mechanism: Periodically prune low-relevance memories based on usage frequency.
- **FR1.6**: API for manual memory injection/retrieval by users.

#### 4.2.2 Self-Analysis of Tools and Codebase
- **FR2.1**: Tool introspection: List and evaluate tools (e.g., via reflection APIs) for usage stats, errors, and efficiency.
- **FR2.2**: Codebase analysis: Parse source code (e.g., using AST in Python) to detect code smells, deprecated libraries, or optimization opportunities.
- **FR2.3**: Performance metrics: Track execution time, error rates, and resource usage; compare against baselines.
- **FR2.4**: Scheduled analysis: Trigger daily or on-demand; support custom triggers (e.g., after N tasks).
- **FR2.5**: Generate reports: Structured output (JSON/Markdown) detailing findings, with severity levels (low/medium/high).

#### 4.2.3 Writing New Features and Improvements
- **FR3.1**: Use LLM for code generation: Prompt with analysis results to produce diffs or full files.
