As a DJ, I want my tracks automatically classified into super genres so I can organize my library for sets.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* **FR-4.1:** System SHALL map Spotify genre tags to super genres using base mapping table
* **FR-4.2:** Super genres SHALL include:
  - Bass, Blues, Books & Spoken, Country, Dance, Disco
  - Drum & Bass, Electronic, Folk, Hip Hop, House
  - Indie-Alternative, Jazz, Latin, Metal, Orchestral

* **FR-4.7:** System SHALL apply genre rules:
  - R&B ≤1990 → Soul-Funk
  - R&B >1990 → Urban
  - 80s synth pop → Pop (not Electronic)
  - Boom bap hip hop → Hip Hop (not Urban)
  - House is priority genre when in doubt

### **4.4.1 Genre Mapping Precedence Rules**

The system applies genre classifications in the following priority order (highest to lowest):

1. **User-Specific Override Mappings** (Highest Priority)
   - Custom mappings in `spotify_genre_map_overrides` table
   - User-defined rules: "jazz fusion" → "Jazz" instead of default "Electronic"
   - Applies to all tracks with matching Spotify genre

2. **Manual User Assignment**
   - Direct assignment of `super_genre` on individual tracks
   - Persists through all sync operations including full re-sync
   - Cannot be overridden by automated processes

3. **Base System Mappings**
   - Default mappings in `spotify_genre_map_base` table
   - Covers 1000+ Spotify genres mapped to 27 super genres
   - Includes special rules (R&B ≤1990 → Soul-Funk, R&B >1990 → Urban)

4. **AI Suggestions** (Lowest Priority)
   - Applied only when no Spotify genre available AND no manual assignment
   - Considers artist's existing genres in user's library
   - Requires user acceptance - never applied automatically

**Conflict Resolution:**
- If multiple rules could apply, higher priority always wins
- Manual assignments are immutable and survive all automated processes
- System logs all genre assignment sources for transparency

**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Dependencies:** spotify_genre_map_base table populated  
**Estimated Effort:** 13 story points

  - AI trigger button per track for individual suggestions
* **FR-5.3:** For each unclassified track, AI SHALL suggest super genre based on:
  - Track title and artist
  - Existing super_genre assignments for other tracks by the same artist in user's `spotify_liked` table
  - Year and other metadata
* **FR-5.4:** AI SHALL query: `SELECT DISTINCT super_genre FROM spotify_liked WHERE primary_artist = ? AND super_genre IS NOT NULL` to find artist's existing genre mappings
* **FR-5.5:** User SHALL be able to:
  - Accept AI suggestion (inline)
  - Reject and manually select different super genre
  - Skip track
* **FR-5.6:** System SHALL provide "Process Next 10" batch button prioritizing unassigned tracks

## **5. Technical Requirements**

### **5.0 Data Model Preservation (Critical Constraint)**

**The existing database schema MUST be preserved and reused.** The current data model represents significant personal work in:

* Genre mapping tables (`spotify_genre_map_base`, `spotify_genre_map_overrides`)
* User's track genre assignments in `spotify_liked.super_genre` column
* Normalized field parsing logic (primary_artist, core_title, featured_artists, mix)
* Sync progress and resumability infrastructure

**Any schema changes MUST:**
1. Be additive only (no breaking changes to existing columns)
2. Maintain backward compatibility with existing data
3. Preserve all user-assigned genre mappings and overrides
4. Not require data migration that could lose genre assignments

### **5.1 Data Models**

**Spotify Liked Track:**
```typescript
interface SpotifyLiked {
  id: string;                    // UUID
  user_id: string;               // Foreign key to auth.users
  spotify_id: string;            // Spotify track ID
  title: string;
  artist: string;
  album?: string;
  genre?: string;                // Raw Spotify genre
  super_genre?: SuperGenre;      // Mapped super genre
  year?: number;
  bpm?: number;
  key?: string;
  added_at?: string;             // When added to Spotify
  normalized_title?: string;
  normalized_artist?: string;
  primary_artist?: string;
  featured_artists?: string[];
  mix?: string;
  core_title?: string;
}
```

**Local MP3:**
```typescript
interface LocalMP3 {
  id: string;                    // UUID
  user_id: string;
  file_path: string;
  title?: string;
  artist?: string;
  album?: string;
  genre?: string;
  year?: number;
  bpm?: number;
  key?: string;
  bitrate?: number;
  file_size?: number;
  hash?: string;                 // For duplicate detection
  normalized_title?: string;
  normalized_artist?: string;
  primary_artist?: string;
  featured_artists?: string[];
  mix?: string;
  core_title?: string;
}
```

**Genre Mapping:**
```typescript
interface GenreMapping {
  spotify_genre: string;         // Primary key
  super_genre: SuperGenre | null;
  updated_at: string;
}

interface GenreOverride {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  spotify_genre: string;
  super_genre: SuperGenre;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### **5.1.1 Data Model Semantics**

**Genre Field Meanings:**
- `genre` (spotify_liked.genre): The genre tag provided by Spotify. NULL means Spotify did not provide any genre metadata for that track.
- `super_genre` (spotify_liked.super_genre): The user's own genre classification, either derived from the genre mapping system or manually assigned.

**"Tracks Without Genre" Count Definition:**
The count of tracks needing genre processing is tracks where BOTH conditions are true:
- `genre IS NULL` (Spotify provided no genre)
- `super_genre IS NULL` (user has not assigned a super genre)

This count excludes:
- Tracks with Spotify genre (they get super_genre via mapping)
- Tracks where user manually assigned super_genre (regardless of Spotify genre)

This ensures the "unmapped/unprocessed" count accurately reflects tracks that truly need AI processing or manual assignment.

---

## **7. Non-Functional Requirements**

### **7.1 Performance**

* **NFR-1:** Sync operations SHALL handle 10,000+ liked songs
* **NFR-2:** Local file scanning SHALL process 1,000+ files per session
* **NFR-3:** Table rendering SHALL remain responsive with 5,000+ rows (virtualization)
* **NFR-4:** Page load time < 3 seconds on broadband connection
* **NFR-5:** Supabase pagination requirements:
  - Default query limit is 1000 rows (silent truncation if exceeded)
  - All queries potentially returning >1000 rows MUST use explicit limit or pagination
  - Pattern: Loop with `.range(offset, offset + PAGE_SIZE - 1)` until empty result
  - Current implementation uses PAGE_SIZE = 1000 for genre caching
  - spotify_liked queries use limit(50000) to handle large collections
* **NFR-6:** Sync batch sizes:
  - Spotify API fetch: 50 tracks per request (Spotify's maximum per page)
  - Database processing: 500 tracks per chunk (CHUNK_SIZE)
  - Artist genre batching: 50 artists per Spotify /artists API call
* **NFR-7:** Spotify API rate limiting strategy:
  - No explicit delay between requests (rely on natural processing time)
  - Respect `Retry-After` header if 429 received
  - For personal use with ~10k tracks: expect sync to complete in <5 minutes
  - Spotify doesn't publish exact limits; ~1 req/sec sustained is safe

### **7.2 Reliability**

* **NFR-8:** Sync operations SHALL be resumable after interruption
* **NFR-9:** Manual genre assignments SHALL persist through full syncs
* **NFR-10:** Spotify token refresh SHALL happen automatically before expiry

### **7.3 Security**

* **NFR-11:** All Spotify tokens SHALL be stored in Supabase Vault
* **NFR-12:** All user data SHALL be protected by Row Level Security
* **NFR-13:** No sensitive data SHALL be logged to console in production

* **NFR-19:** Users MAY delete their data at any time via account settings
* **NFR-20:** Spotify tokens are refreshed automatically; stale connections (>90 days inactive) MAY be flagged for cleanup
* **NFR-21:** Sync progress records older than 30 days SHALL be automatically purged

### **7.8 Error Handling & Recovery**

* **NFR-22:** System SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested actions within 200ms of error detection
* **NFR-23:** Users SHALL be able to retry failed operations without data loss or duplicate processing
* **NFR-24:** Sync interruptions SHALL preserve progress and allow resume from last successful checkpoint
* **NFR-25:** Error states SHALL not block other application functionality (graceful degradation)
* **NFR-26:** Critical errors SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging while maintaining user privacy
* **NFR-27:** Network timeouts SHALL not exceed 30 seconds with clear progress indication

## **12. Appendix**

### **12.1 Super Genre Definitions**

| Super Genre | Description | Example Spotify Genres |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| House | Electronic dance music, 4/4 beat | deep house, tech house, progressive house |
| Drum & Bass | Fast breakbeat electronic | jungle, liquid funk, neurofunk |

| Unclassified | Unknown or edge cases | (tracks without mapping) |

### **12.2 Glossary**

* **Super Genre:** High-level genre classification used by DJs (vs granular Spotify genres)
* **Gap Analysis:** Comparison between Spotify and local library to find missing tracks
* **Normalized:** Cleaned string (lowercase, no special chars) for matching
* **Override:** User-specific genre mapping that supersedes base mapping

### **12.3 Known Data Quality Findings**

**Duplicate Tracks Analysis (December 2025):**

Database analysis identified approximately 20 duplicate track pairs in `spotify_liked` table with identical `title` AND `artist` values. Total tracks: 4,987.

**Example Duplicates:**
| Title | Artist | Count |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Texas Sun | Khruangbin, Leon Bridges | 2 |
| Cherry-coloured Funk | Cocteau Twins | 2 |
| God Only Knows - Remastered 1996 | The Beach Boys | 2 |
| The Less I Know The Better | Tame Impala | 2 |
| Rhymes Like Dimes | MF DOOM | 2 |
| Life On Mars? - 2015 Remaster | David Bowie | 2 |
| Bizarre Love Triangle | New Order | 2 |
| Fela Kuti | GoldLink, Wale | 2 |

**Root Cause:**
Normalization fields (`normalized_title`, `normalized_artist`) are not populated during sync, preventing effective deduplication.

**Future Considerations:**
- Implement normalization during sync process
- Add unique constraint on normalized fields
- Create cleanup script for existing duplicates
