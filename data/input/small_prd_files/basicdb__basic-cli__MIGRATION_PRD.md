- `account` - Display user information
- `init` - Interactive project creation/import with forms
- `projects` - List projects in table format
- `status` - Schema status checking with version comparison
- `push` - Push schema changes to remote
- `pull` - Pull schema from remote with conflict resolution
- `version` - Version info with update checking
- `update` - Self-update via npm
- `help` - Command documentation
