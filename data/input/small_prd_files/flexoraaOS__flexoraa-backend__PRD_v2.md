## Core Modules

### 1. LeadOS (WhatsApp-First Lead Engine)

#### Lead Intake & Verification
- **Sources**: WhatsApp inbound, website forms, CRM API, CSV import
- **Verification checks**: Phone validity, device status, duplicate detection, fraud scoring
- **Country normalization**: E.164 format conversion
- **Token cost**: 0.5 tokens per verification

#### AI Conversational Qualification
- **Multi-turn conversation**: 6-turn structured interviews extracting intent, budget, timeline
- **Extraction fields**: Intent (High/Medium/Low), Budget ($1K-5K / $5K-50K / $50K+), Timeline (Immediate / 1-3mo / 3-6mo / Exploring)
- **Objections & buying signals**: Detected and stored for routing logic
- **Psychology-driven prompts**: Scarcity, authority, urgency, social proof, reciprocity
- **Token cost**: 2 tokens per AI qualification message

#### Lead Scoring Engine
- **Scoring formula**: 5-factor weighted algorithm
  - Budget (30%): Indicates purchase power
  - Intent (25%): High-intent signals (ready to buy)
  - Engagement (20%): Response depth and turn completion
  - Latency (15%): Response speed (faster = higher intent)
  - Lifecycle (10%): Lead age + interaction count

- **Score ranges**:
  - **HOT**: 61-100 (ready to buy, immediate action)
  - **WARM**: 31-60 (exploring, nurturing required)
  - **COLD**: 0-30 (early stage, 24h AI recovery)

- **Audit trail**: All scores stored with top-3 factors + reasoning
- **Token cost**: 0.5 tokens per score calculation

#### Intelligent Routing
- **HOT leads**: Instantly routed to available SDR (SLA: 10m response)
- **WARM leads**: Equally distributed across SDR pool (SLA: 24-72h)
- **COLD leads**: AI attempts 24h recovery, then routes to junior SDR pool
- **SDR payload**: Last 5 messages, score, top-3 factors, metadata, profile link
- **Token cost**: 1 token per routing decision

#### Auto-Escalation Logic
**Triggers** (immediate SDR escalation):
- AI confidence < 0.6 (unsure about lead)
- High-ticket query ($50K+ budget mentioned)
- "Ready to buy" or "schedule call" signals
- Legal/financial/medical sensitive keywords
- Competitor mention
- 3+ objections detected

#### Appointment Booking Workflow
- **Phase 1**: AI offers 3 pre-selected quick slots (next 7 days)
- **Phase 2**: If user wants more → full calendar link
- **Phase 3**: Confirmation + reminders + SDR notified
- **Integration**: Google Calendar / Outlook API
- **Token cost**: 1 token per appointment

#### Lead Leakage Prevention
- **Scan frequency**: Every 5-10 minutes per tenant
- **Detection**: Unreplied SDR messages (>30min), unseen lead messages
- **Actions**: AI re-engagement for HOT, reassignment for WARM, escalation for Cold
- **SLA**: Alert SDR within 2 minutes

- **Full OS**: Full 360° profile + historical data + first/last touch tracking + engagement trends + predictive scoring

#### Cross-Platform Learning
- Behavior from one channel informs responses on other channels
- SDR assignment optimization based on historical performance
- Predictive scoring: Likelihood to convert within 30 days

#### Event-Driven Automation
- Lead created → Score calculated → Routed to SDR
- Message received → Intent detected → AI response generated → Scored → Escalated if needed
- Appointment booked → Reminder queued → SDR notified → Post-call follow-up scheduled

---

## Billing System (Token-Based Model)

### Token Economics & Pricing Logic

**Why tokens = 50% of subscription value?**

**Margin Philosophy:**
```
LeadOS Starter: $500/mo → 250 tokens/mo credit
LeadOS Pro: $1,500/mo → 750 tokens/mo credit
AgentOS Starter: $800/mo → 400 tokens/mo credit
Full OS: $2,000/mo → 1,000 tokens/mo credit
```

**50% allocation ensures:**
1. **Cost Determinism**: OpenAI (40%) + Infrastructure (20%) + Margin (40%)
2. **Predictable Capacity**: 2x safety margin prevents over-subscription
3. **Abuse Prevention**: Built-in daily burn limits
4. **Upsell Incentive**: Customers at 80% tokens see upgrade offer

### Rate Card (Tokens Per Operation)

| Operation | Tokens | Justification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Lead Verification | 0.5 | API call only |
| Lead Scoring | 0.5 | Lightweight DB |
| WhatsApp Message (inbound) | 0.1 | No AI cost |
| AI Classification (intent) | 1.0 | OpenAI API |
| AI Qualification Message | 2.0 | Multi-turn API |
| AI Persuasion Message | 3.0 | Psychology+API |
| Cold Recovery (24h) | 2.5 | Custom prompt |
| Escalation Decision | 0.5 | Rule evaluation |
| Appointment Booking | 1.0 | Calendar + msg |
| Routing Decision | 1.0 | SDR assignment |
| Social Media DM (inbound) | 0.2 | API ingestion |
| High-Risk Review (human) | 5.0 | Manual review |

### Token Top-Up (Razorpay)

**Tiered Pricing:**
- 100 tokens: $50 ($0.50/token)
- 500 tokens: $200 ($0.40/token, 20% discount)
- 1000 tokens: $350 ($0.35/token, 30% discount)
- 5000 tokens: $1500 ($0.30/token, 40% discount)

**Threshold Alerts:**
- 50% consumed: Warning email
- 80% consumed: Urgent notification + upgrade offer
- 100% consumed: Service paused (wait for manual top-up or renewal)

### Abuse Protection

**Daily Burn Limits (by subscription tier):**
- LeadOS Starter: 8 tokens/day
- LeadOS Pro: 24 tokens/day
- AgentOS Starter: 13 tokens/day
- Full OS: 32 tokens/day

**Token Drain Attack Detection:**
- Abnormal burn spike (10x increase in 1 hour) → Pause high-token operations
- Repeated failures (>100/hour) → Rate limit tenant
- Spam lead creation (20x increase) → Block new intake

**Backpressure Handling:**
- Queue depth >5000: Switch to template mode (no AI)
- Queue depth >2000: Disable persuasion variants
- Queue depth >1000: Defer analytics & leakage scans

---

## Security & Compliance

### Tenant Isolation & Encryption

**Multi-Tenant Architecture:**
- Database-level RLS (Row-Level Security) = logical isolation
- Tenant-specific AES-256 encryption keys (AWS KMS) = cryptographic isolation
- Even database admin cannot read encrypted data

**RLS Policies:**
- Tenants can only see their own leads
- SDRs can only see assigned leads
- Managers can see all leads in tenant
- Audit logs immutable (append-only)

### Immutable Audit Logs

**Why append-only?**
- Regulatory requirement (India IT Act, WhatsApp audit)
- Cannot alter historical events retroactively
- Cryptographic chain: Each event references previous hash

**Critical Events Logged:**
- Lead created/verified/scored/escalated/routed/appointed
- Token deducted/topped-up
- User access granted/revoked
- Encryption key rotation
- High-risk queries escalated
- Data export/deletion requested

### WhatsApp Compliance

**24-Hour Session Window Rule:**
- Can send freeform messages only within 24h of customer's last message
- After 24h: Must use approved message templates
- Template categories: Authentication, Promotional, Transactional

**Compliant vs Non-Compliant:**
✅ **Compliant**: Freeform within 24h OR approved template outside 24h
❌ **Violation**: Freeform outside 24h (account suspension risk)

**Message Template Validation:**
- All templates must be pre-approved by Meta
- Template audit trail maintained
- Auto-fallback to templates if session expires

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

| Role | Leads | SDRs | Settings | Billing | Audit |
|------|-------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| **Admin** | Full | Full | Full | Full | Full |
| **Manager** | R/W | Read | Read | Read | Full |
| **SDR** | R (assigned only) | — | — | — | — |
| **Product** | Read | — | R/W | — | Read |
| **DevOps** | — | — | Infra | — | Logs |
| **Auditor** | Read | — | — | — | Full |
| **ReadOnly** | Read | — | — | — | — |

**Security Controls:**
- MFA enforced for Admin/Manager
- JWT tokens with 24h expiry
- Session timeout: 30 minutes
- TLS encryption in transit
- AES-256 at rest
- Key rotation: 90 days

---

## Compliance & Privacy

### Consent Capture & Proof
- Timestamped consent records (channel-specific)
- Immutable proof with IP + user agent
- Audit trail for compliance reporting
- Can be retrieved for WhatsApp/IT Act audits

### Data Retention & PII Masking
- **Full conversations**: 24 months (hard delete after)
- **PII unmasked**: 6 months
- **PII masked**: Keep for deduplication (indefinitely)
- **Audit logs**: Indefinitely (never delete)

### WhatsApp/Meta Policy Compliance
- Template submission workflow
- Session window enforcement
- Rate limit compliance (no spam)
- Account suspension recovery procedures

### Legal Policy Integration
- Refund rules (T&C)
- Token usage terms
