# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview

A Central Blood Bank Management System (CBMS) aims to streamline the process of blood donation, management, and distribution.

The system will cater to four primary user roles: Donors, Hospital Officials, Blood Bank Officials, and System Admins.

The platform will ensure efficient handling of blood donations, requests, and stock management.

## Users and User Stories

**1. Donors**

**User Stories:**

- As a donor, I want to log in to the website with my email and password ( OPTIONAL:or through Google), so I can access my account easily.
- As a donor, I want to register by providing my national ID, name, city, email, password, blood group, and last donation date, so I can become a registered donor.
- As a donor, I want to request an appointment to donate blood to the blood bank, so I can schedule my donations conveniently.
- OPTIONAL: As a donor, I want to view my donation history, so I can keep track of my past donations.
- As a donor, I want to receive emails about the acceptance or rejection of my donations, so I can stay informed.
- OPTIONAL: As a donor, I want to get notified if there is a hospital need for my blood type and I am eligible to donate, so I can help in emergencies.

**2. Hospital Officials**

**User Stories:**

- As a hospital official, I want to log in with my email and password, so I can access my account securely.
- As a hospital official, I want to sign up with my email, password, hospital name, and hospital city, so I can register my hospital in the system.
- As a hospital official, I want to search for available blood stocks and request blood, confirming patient name, blood group, status, and the city of the blood bank, so I can fulfill the hospital's blood requirements.
- OPTIONAL: As a hospital official, I want to request a new donation if a blood type is not available, so I can ensure the availability of necessary blood types.
- OPTIONAL: As a hospital official, I want to see the history of requested blood, so I can track past requests.

**3. Blood Bank Officials**

**User Stories:**

- As a blood bank official, I want to confirm donor appointments, so I can manage the donation schedule.
- As a blood bank official, I want to confirm if the donated blood is virus-free and add it to stocks, so I can ensure the safety and availability of blood.
- As a blood bank official, I want to accept hospital requests, so I can distribute blood efficiently.
- OPTIONAL: As a blood bank official, I want to notify donors if they are eligible to donate and if a hospital needs their blood type, so I can encourage timely donations.

**4. System Admins**

**User Stories:**

- As a system admin, I want to activate or deactivate hospital and blood bank officials' access and privileges, so I can manage user roles and ensure system security.
