# Government of Canada Design System - Product Requirements Document

A comprehensive showcase of production-ready UI components following the Government of Canada design standards, built for accessibility and bilingual support.

## Experience Qualities

1. **Professional** - Components reflect the authority and trustworthiness expected of government digital services
2. **Accessible** - Every component meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
3. **Inclusive** - Bilingual-ready architecture supporting both English and French throughout the system

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
This is a component showcase demonstrating form inputs, data display, navigation patterns, and interactive elements. The focus is on demonstrating component variety and accessibility features rather than complex application logic.

## Essential Features

### Component Showcase
- **Functionality**: Display all available GC Design System components with interactive examples
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate component variants, states, and proper usage patterns
- **Trigger**: User navigates to the application
- **Progression**: Load page → View component categories in tabs → Interact with examples → See real-time component behavior
- **Success criteria**: All 15+ components render correctly, maintain accessibility features, and demonstrate proper government styling

### Interactive Form Elements
- **Functionality**: Demonstrate all form inputs with validation, labels, and error states
- **Purpose**: Show proper form design patterns for government applications
- **Trigger**: User selects "Form Elements" tab
- **Progression**: View form → Fill inputs → See validation → Submit form → Receive feedback
- **Success criteria**: All inputs are keyboard accessible, properly labeled, and show appropriate feedback

### Data Display Components
- **Functionality**: Show tables, badges, progress indicators, and pagination
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate how to present government data accessibly
- **Trigger**: User selects "Data Display" tab
- **Progression**: View examples → Interact with pagination → See table sorting → Observe badge variants
- **Success criteria**: Data is presented clearly with proper semantic HTML and ARIA labels

### Alert & Notification System
- **Functionality**: Display various alert types with dismissible functionality
- **Purpose**: Show proper feedback patterns for government services
- **Trigger**: User views alert examples or interacts with forms
- **Progression**: See alert → Read message → Optionally dismiss → Alert removed from view
- **Success criteria**: Alerts announce to screen readers, are keyboard dismissible, and follow GC color standards

### Navigation Components
- **Functionality**: Demonstrate breadcrumbs, tabs, accordion, and pagination
- **Purpose**: Show proper navigation patterns for multi-page government services
- **Trigger**: User interacts with navigation elements
- **Progression**: Click element → Navigate to new view → Maintain context → Return to previous state
- **Success criteria**: Navigation is keyboard accessible, maintains focus management, and provides clear affordances

## Edge Case Handling

- **Empty States** - Tables show "No data available" message when empty
- **Long Content** - Tables are horizontally scrollable on small screens
- **Disabled States** - All interactive elements have proper disabled states with reduced opacity
- **Form Validation** - Inputs show error states with descriptive messages when validation fails
- **Keyboard Navigation** - All components work without a mouse using Tab, Enter, Space, and Arrow keys

## Design Direction

The design should feel authoritative, trustworthy, and professional - reflecting the Government of Canada's digital presence. It should be clean and minimal, prioritizing content clarity and accessibility over decorative elements. The interface uses a restrained color palette dominated by blues (representing trust and government), with strategic use of white space to prevent overwhelm.

## Color Selection

**Analogous** - Blue-focused palette with adjacent colors for secondary actions, maintaining consistency with the Canada.ca brand.

- **Primary Color**: Deep blue `oklch(0.45 0.12 250)` - Represents trust, authority, and official government presence. Used for primary actions and key UI elements.
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Orange/Amber `oklch(0.50 0.20 25)` for supertask actions (high-priority government services)
  - Muted gray `oklch(0.96 0 0)` for backgrounds and secondary UI elements
- **Accent Color**: Medium blue-green `oklch(0.55 0.15 150)` for success states and positive feedback
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background White `oklch(0.98 0 0)`: Dark gray text `oklch(0.20 0 0)` - Ratio 15.8:1 ✓
  - Card White `oklch(1 0 0)`: Dark gray text `oklch(0.20 0 0)` - Ratio 16.9:1 ✓
  - Primary Blue `oklch(0.45 0.12 250)`: White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Secondary Orange `oklch(0.50 0.20 25)`: White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 6.4:1 ✓
  - Accent Blue-Green `oklch(0.55 0.15 150)`: White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 5.2:1 ✓
  - Muted Gray `oklch(0.96 0 0)`: Medium gray text `oklch(0.45 0 0)` - Ratio 7.1:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should be highly legible, professional, and work well at government scale. System fonts are preferred for performance and consistency across devices.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Title): Sans-serif Bold/36px/tight letter spacing - Primary page headings
  - H2 (Section Title): Sans-serif Bold/24px/normal letter spacing - Major sections
  - H3 (Subsection): Sans-serif Semibold/18px/normal letter spacing - Component groups
  - Body Text: Sans-serif Regular/16px/1.5 line height - Main content and descriptions
  - Small Text: Sans-serif Regular/14px/1.5 line height - Helper text and metadata
  - Button Text: Sans-serif Semibold/16px/normal letter spacing - Action labels

## Animations

Animations are purposeful and subtle, used to maintain context during state changes rather than for decoration. The system feels responsive and predictable, with smooth transitions that guide attention without creating distraction.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Transitions communicate state changes (accordion expand/collapse, tab switching) while maintaining spatial relationships. Focus indicators appear with subtle scale/shadow changes to aid keyboard navigation.
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary actions (button presses, form submissions) receive immediate feedback (200ms), while contextual changes (tab switching, accordion) use moderate timing (300ms). Page-level changes are reserved for actual navigation, not component interaction.

## Component Selection

- **Components**: 
  - **GCButton** - Primary, secondary, supertask, danger, and link variants with size options
  - **GCInput, GCTextarea, GCCheckbox, GCRadio, GCSelect** - Full-featured form controls with labels, helper text, and error states
  - **GCAlert** - Info, success, warning, danger variants with dismissible option
  - **GCCard** - Content containers with optional headers and footers
  - **GCBadge** - Status indicators in multiple colors
  - **GCTable** - Data tables with striped rows, hover states, and custom cell rendering
  - **GCBreadcrumb** - Navigation trail with home icon
  - **GCPagination** - Page navigation with ellipsis for long lists
  - **GCTabs** - Content organization with keyboard navigation
  - **GCAccordion** - Expandable content sections
  - **GCProgressBar** - Visual progress indicators with labels and percentages
  
- **Customizations**: Components use Tailwind utilities with GC-specific color values in oklch format. Focus rings use GC blue, borders are consistent 1-2px, and spacing follows an 8px grid.

- **States**: All interactive elements include default, hover, active, focus, and disabled states. Focus states use 2px solid rings with 2px offset. Disabled states reduce opacity to 50% and change cursor to not-allowed.

- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor Icons Regular weight for UI elements - House (home), CaretRight (breadcrumb), CaretDown (accordion/select), CaretLeft/Right (pagination), Info, Warning, CheckCircle, XCircle (alerts), Download, PaperPlaneTilt, MagnifyingGlass (actions).

- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing using Tailwind's scale: gap-2 (8px) between related elements, gap-4 (16px) between components, gap-6 (24px) between sections, gap-8 (32px) between major page areas. Padding follows similar scale with px-4 py-2 for buttons, px-3 py-2 for inputs.

- **Mobile**: All components are fully responsive. Forms stack vertically, tables scroll horizontally, tabs may stack on narrow viewports, and cards reflow from multi-column to single column. Touch targets are minimum 44px for mobile accessibility. The layout uses a mobile-first approach with max-w-7xl container and responsive padding.
