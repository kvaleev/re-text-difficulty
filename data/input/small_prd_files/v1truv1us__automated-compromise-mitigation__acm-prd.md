# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Automated Compromise Mitigation (ACM)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Status:** Draft  
**Project Type:** Open-Source Security Tool

---

## Executive Summary

### Overview

Automated Compromise Mitigation (ACM) is a local-first, zero-knowledge application that automatically detects and remediates compromised credentials following data breaches. The system operates entirely on the user's device, integrating with password manager CLIs to rotate credentials only when necessary—after confirmed compromise—while maintaining strict adherence to zero-knowledge security principles.

### Core Value Proposition

ACM resolves the fundamental conflict between security necessity (credential rotation post-breach) and user convenience (avoiding the behavioral burdens that lead to poor password hygiene). By automating rotation exclusively when required and operating under a local-first, zero-knowledge paradigm, ACM maximizes security while maintaining user trust.

### Strategic Architecture

ACM is composed of two separable, strictly local-first services:

1. **Credential Remediation Service (CRS)**: Interfaces with password manager CLIs, generates new credentials, and updates local vault entries. Operates purely locally with zero-knowledge security mandate.

2. **Automated Compliance Validation Service (ACVS)**: Executes automated rotation workflows and validates third-party Terms of Service (ToS) compliance. Operates as opt-in feature using personal API tokens and authenticated methods provided by end-users. All processing, including Legal NLP models for ToS analysis, runs locally on the user's device.

---

## 1. Product Vision and Goals

### 1.1 Vision Statement

To provide security-conscious users with a trustworthy, transparent, and automated solution for credential breach remediation that never compromises their master password, vault data, or privacy.

### 1.2 Strategic Goals

| Goal | Description | Success Metric |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Automate breach response** | Automatically detect and rotate compromised credentials via password manager CLIs | 100% success rate in rotating detected compromised credentials within local vault |
| **Maintain zero-knowledge security** | Ensure all sensitive data and processing remain local to user's device | Zero external data transmission; passes independent security audits |
| **Comply with third-party ToS** | Validate automation actions and avoid ToS violations through ACVS | Zero reports of ToS violations triggered by ACM automation |
| **Build user trust via transparency** | Operate as open-source, auditable project with clear security documentation | Active community contributions; positive security reviews |
| **Legal protection for contributors** | Enforce strong EULA with indemnification and limitation of liability | Legal framework approved by community legal review |
| **Community-driven governance** | Establish clear, consensus-based decision-making for technical and legal matters | Active contributor base; transparent RFC process |

### 1.3 Non-Goals (Explicit Scope Limitations)

- **Not a password manager replacement**: ACM augments existing password managers, never replaces them
- **Not universal unattended automation**: MFA, CAPTCHA, and anti-bot measures require Human-in-the-Middle (HIM) workflows
- **Not a cloud service**: ACM runs exclusively locally; no SaaS offering planned
- **Not a breach detection service**: ACM relies on existing password manager breach reports or user-provided breach data
- **Not suitable for non-technical users initially**: Phase I targets security professionals and developers

---

## 2. Target Users and Personas

### 2.1 Primary User Personas

#### Persona 1: Security-Conscious Developer
- **Profile**: Software engineer or security researcher who manages 100+ accounts
- **Pain Points**: Manual rotation is time-consuming; concerned about breach response time; distrusts cloud-based solutions
- **Needs**: CLI-first workflow, scriptable automation, transparent security model
- **Technical Skill**: High — comfortable with CLIs, understands mTLS and certificate-based auth

#### Persona 2: Privacy-Focused Professional
- **Profile**: Journalist, activist, or professional handling sensitive information
- **Pain Points**: Cannot trust centralized services; requires audit trail; needs immediate breach response
- **Needs**: Local-first operation, zero-knowledge guarantee, compliance evidence chain
- **Technical Skill**: Medium — can follow setup instructions, prefers GUI but will use TUI if necessary

#### Persona 3: Compliance Officer / IT Security Manager
- **Profile**: Manages credential policies for organization or personal high-security accounts
- **Pain Points**: Needs proof of timely credential rotation; must document compliance; requires automation that respects ToS
- **Needs**: Audit logs, compliance validation reports, ToS analysis, evidence chains
- **Technical Skill**: Medium-high — understands security concepts, needs clear documentation

### 2.2 Secondary User Personas (Future Phases)

- **Enterprise Security Teams**: Deploy ACM across workstations with centralized policy management
- **Password Manager Power Users**: Early adopters who want cutting-edge security features
- **Open-Source Security Contributors**: Developers who extend ACM with new integrations or compliance models

- **Idempotency**: Repeated rotation attempts for same credential must be safe and predictable
- **Error Recovery**: Partial rotations must be resumable or cleanly reversed

### 6.2 Usability

- **Installation**: Single-command install via package managers (Homebrew, apt, Chocolatey)
- **Configuration**: Zero-config for basic use; advanced settings in `.acm/config.yaml`
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive user guide, security architecture documentation, API reference
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages with suggested remediation steps

### 6.3 Maintainability

- **Code Quality**: Go code follows standard idioms; passes `golangci-lint` checks

- **Documentation**: All public APIs documented with GoDoc; architecture decisions recorded in ADRs
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning; clear upgrade paths with migration guides

### 6.4 Extensibility

- **Password Manager Plugins**: Modular architecture allows adding new password manager integrations
- **Legal NLP Models**: Plugin system for custom ToS analysis models
- **Audit Log Exporters**: Extensible format system (JSON, CSV, PDF)
- **API Stability**: Public gRPC API versioned; breaking changes follow deprecation policy

## 8. Risk Assessment Summary

### 8.1 Critical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Automation blocked by MFA/CAPTCHA** | High — prevents unattended rotation | High — widespread deployment of anti-bot measures | **HIM Workflow**: Mandatory pause for user intervention; clear UX for verification |
| **ToS violation liability** | High — user account termination, potential legal action | Medium — varies by site and automation method | **ACVS**: Mandatory compliance validation with CRC; opt-in with EULA indemnification |
| **Local compromise exposes decrypted credentials** | Critical — full vault compromise | Low — requires local system access | **Security hardening**: Memory locking, secure storage integration, process isolation |
| **Legal liability for project contributors** | High — lawsuits from users or third parties | Low-Medium — depends on EULA enforcement | **Legal Framework**: Strong indemnification + limitation of liability + open-source license |
| **Password manager CLI API changes** | Medium — breaks integration | Medium — CLIs evolve over time | **Version detection**: Pin to specific CLI versions; graceful degradation; community-driven updates |

### 8.2 Secondary Risks

- **NLP model inaccuracy**: Legal NLP misinterprets ToS → false positives/negatives in CRC
- **Certificate management complexity**: Users struggle with mTLS setup → abandonment
- **Performance on low-end hardware**: NLP processing slow on older machines → poor UX
- **Open-source governance disputes**: Community disagreements stall development → fork risk
