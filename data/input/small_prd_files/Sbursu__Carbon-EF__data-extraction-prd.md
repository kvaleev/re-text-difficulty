# Product Requirements Document:

# Data Extraction and Cleaning for Adaptive Global LCA Advisor

## 1. Introduction and Project Context

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the requirements for the data extraction and cleaning phase of the Adaptive Global LCA Advisor project, focusing on Milestone 1: Regional EF Knowledge Graph. This phase will establish the foundation for a unified dataset with regional adjustments that will power the AI-driven emission factor recommendation system.

### 1.2 Project Overview

The Adaptive Global LCA Advisor aims to develop an AI system that recommends region-specific emission factors (EFs) for accurate carbon accounting. This system addresses limitations in existing solutions like Parakeet's static datasets and LEAF's single region focus. The project combines LLM fine-tuning with dynamic RAG for real-time EF updates.

### 1.3 Scope

This PRD covers:

- Data sources identification and prioritization
- Data extraction methodologies
- Data cleaning procedures
- Data harmonization and standardization
- Storage architecture
- Quality assurance and validation

## 2. Business Requirements

### 2.1 Problem Statement

- 73% of food products lack environmental labels
- Manual EF selection causes 15-30% error rates in carbon reporting
- EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) requires precise regional EF mapping
- Existing solutions provide either static datasets or focus on single regions

### 2.2 Success Criteria

- Creation of a unified dataset containing ~34,220 EF nodes (23,520 after harmonization)
- Coverage of EFs for 101 regions including major economies (54.5% global coverage)
- Database structure enabling <200ms retrieval times
- Harmonized data schema across 8 distinct source datasets
- Documented regional adjustment factors with 1,233 records (5.2%) having regional multipliers applied
- Reduction of error rates from 15-30% to <5% MAPE against EXIOBASE regional data

## 6. Data Harmonization

### 6.1 Schema Standardization

Create a unified schema with consistent field names and formats:

```python
standard_schema = {
    "entity_id": "str",         # Unique identifier
    "entity_name": "str",       # Human-readable name
    "entity_type": "str",       # "product", "sector", or "process"

}
```

### 6.2 Cross-Dataset Mapping

#### 6.2.1 Product Mapping

1. Create master product taxonomy

   - Country → Region → Continent → Global
3. Handle special cases
   - EU as both region and collection of countries
   - Special economic zones
   - Disputed territories
4. Actual regional distribution:
   - Global (GLB): 54.5% of records
   - France (FR): 12.0% of records

   - Actual distribution: High (>0.7): 23,419 records (99.6%), Medium (0.6-0.7): 67 records (0.3%), Low (<0.6): 34 records (0.1%)
2. Tag with data provenance information
3. Include timestamp information
   - Original source date
   - Processing date
   - Expected validity period

### 6.4 Harmonization Workflow

1. Process each dataset through standardization pipeline
2. Apply crosswalk mappings
3. Merge datasets with conflict resolution rules
   - Prefer higher confidence sources
   - Prefer more recent data
   - Average values with similar confidence
4. Apply IPCC regional multipliers
   - Actual results: 1,233 records (5.2%) have multipliers applied
   - Distribution by entity type: Products (532), Sectors (482), Energy (93), Manufacturing (39), Agriculture (32), Buildings (27), Transportation (21), Other (7)
   - Distribution by source: USEEIO_v2.1 (482), Agribalyse_3.1 (381), Climate_TRACE (162), EXIOBASE_3.8 (151), IPCC_EFDB (57)
