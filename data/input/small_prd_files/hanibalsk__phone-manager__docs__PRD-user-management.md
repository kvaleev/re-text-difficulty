# Phone Manager - User Management & Device Control PRD

**Author:** Martin
**Date:** 2025-12-01
**Project Level:** 3 (Full Product)
**Project Type:** Mobile Application Enhancement
**Target Scale:** ~50 stories across 6 epics
**Source:** Specification files (docs/specs/)

---

## Description, Context and Goals

### Description

Add comprehensive user management, authentication, group-based access control, and remote device settings management to Phone Manager. This feature transforms Phone Manager from a device-centric to a user-centric platform while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing device-only installations.

### Deployment Intent

- **Android App**: Google Play Store update
- **Backend**: Rust/Axum API extension
- **Admin Portal**: New Next.js web application
- **Target Audience**: B2C families, B2B enterprises

### Context

Phone Manager currently operates in a device-centric model where each device has a unique API key and belongs to a group identified by a simple group ID. There is no user authentication, ownership model, or administrative control over device settings.

**Current State:**
- Device registration via X-API-Key
- Simple group membership by groupId string
- All settings controlled locally on device
- No user accounts
- No administrative oversight

**Desired State:**
- User accounts with email/password and OAuth
- Devices owned by users
- Groups with role-based membership (owner, admin, member)
- Remote settings control by administrators
- Setting locks that prevent user modification
- B2B support for enterprise device fleets
- Full admin web portal

### Goals

1. **Enable User Identity** - Users can create accounts and authenticate across devices
2. **Establish Device Ownership** - Devices are linked to user accounts
3. **Implement Group Hierarchy** - Groups have owners and admins who can manage members
4. **Remote Settings Control** - Administrators can view and modify member device settings
5. **Setting Locks** - Administrators can lock settings to prevent user changes
6. **B2B Enterprise Support** - Companies can provision devices and manage fleets
7. **Maintain Backward Compatibility** - Existing devices continue working without accounts

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: New User Registration
```
1. User opens app → Sees "Sign In" option in settings
2. User taps "Create Account" → Registration form
3. User enters email, password, display name
4. System creates account → Issues JWT tokens
5. User's current device automatically linked to account
6. User can now see their device in "My Devices"
```

### Journey 2: Join a Family Group
```
1. Family admin creates group "Smith Family"
2. Admin generates invite code → Shares with family member
3. Family member opens app → Taps "Join Group"
4. Enters invite code → Joins group as member
5. Can now see family members' locations on map
```

### Journey 3: Admin Locks Setting
```
1. Parent (admin) opens group settings
2. Selects child's device → Views device settings
3. Toggles "tracking_enabled" lock ON
4. Child receives push notification: "Settings updated by admin"
5. Child sees lock icon on tracking setting → Cannot change
```

### Journey 4: User Requests Unlock
```
1. User sees locked setting they want to change
2. Taps "Request Unlock" → Enters reason
3. Admin receives notification of unlock request
4. Admin reviews and approves request
5. User receives notification → Setting now unlocked
```

### Journey 5: B2B Device Enrollment
```
1. IT admin logs into Admin Portal
2. Creates enrollment token for department
3. Generates QR code → Distributes to employees
4. Employee scans QR during app setup
5. Device automatically configured with company policy
6. IT admin sees device in fleet dashboard
```

## UX Design Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
- Core functionality available without account
- Advanced features unlock with registration
- B2B features hidden from consumer users

### 2. Clear Permission Indicators
- Lock icons on locked settings
- "Managed by [admin]" labels where applicable
- Clear role badges in group member lists

### 3. Non-Intrusive Admin Control
- Push notifications for settings changes
- Ability to request unlocks
- Transparent about who changed what

### 4. Backward Compatibility First
- No forced migration prompts
- Existing devices work indefinitely
- Account creation is optional

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for this PRD:

1. **Multi-tenancy database isolation** - Single database with org_id filtering
2. **SSO/SAML integration** - OAuth only for initial release
3. **Two-factor authentication** - Planned for future release
4. **Mobile device management (MDM)** - Focus on app-level settings only
5. **Real-time collaboration** - Polling-based updates only
6. **White-label customization** - Standard branding only
7. **Offline-first architecture** - Requires connectivity for auth/sync

---

## Next Steps

1. **Architecture Review** - Review with Architect agent for technical feasibility
2. **Security Review** - Engage security review for auth/token design
3. **Epic Prioritization** - Confirm epic order with stakeholders
4. **Story Breakdown** - Create detailed story files for Epic 9 first
5. **API Design Review** - Validate API contracts with frontend team
