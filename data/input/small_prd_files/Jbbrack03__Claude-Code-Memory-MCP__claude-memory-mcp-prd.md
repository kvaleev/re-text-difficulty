# Product Requirements Document: Claude Code Memory MCP Server

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Overview
The Claude Code Memory MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides persistent, intelligent memory capabilities for Claude Code sessions. It addresses the critical limitation where Claude Code loses context between sessions, leading to repeated mistakes, forgotten decisions, and inefficient development workflows.

### 1.2 Key Value Propositions
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains project history, decisions, and patterns across Claude Code sessions
- **Hallucination Prevention**: Captures only verified events through hooks, preventing false memory corruption
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Provides relevant context exactly when needed during development
- **Git-Aware**: Synchronizes with Git branches and validates against repository truth
- **Production-Ready**: Built with defensive programming, comprehensive monitoring, and self-healing capabilities

### 1.3 Target Users
- Individual developers using Claude Code for project development
- Teams wanting consistent AI assistance across sessions (future enhancement)
- Developers working on large projects exceeding Claude's context window

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current Limitations
1. **Claude Code has no memory between sessions**, forcing developers to repeatedly explain context
2. **The Claude.md file approach fails at scale** - limited to 40K characters
3. **Hallucinations can corrupt project understanding** if stored as fact
4. **No awareness of Git state** leads to conflicts with version control
5. **Lack of project-specific context** causes repeated mistakes

### 2.2 Impact
- Developers waste time re-explaining project structure
- Claude makes the same mistakes repeatedly
- Complex architectural decisions are forgotten
- Testing patterns and error resolutions are lost
- Project momentum suffers from context resets

## 3. Solution Overview

### 3.1 Core Concept
A defensive, Git-aware MCP server that:
1. **Captures verified events** through Claude Code hooks
2. **Stores intelligent memories** with vector embeddings
3. **Injects relevant context** at the right moments
4. **Maintains data integrity** through transactions and validation
5. **Synchronizes with Git** for ground truth

### 3.2 Architecture Principles
- **Defensive Programming**: Assume everything can fail
- **Local-First**: Minimize external dependencies
- **Workspace Isolation**: Complete separation between projects
- **Verified Data Only**: Hooks ensure only real events are stored
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work without advanced capabilities

## 4. Functional Requirements
