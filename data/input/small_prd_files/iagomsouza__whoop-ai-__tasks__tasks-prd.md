### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

## Epic 4: Secure OpenAI API Proxy Implementation

### Relevant Files

- `server/index.ts` (or `server/server.js`) - Main file for the Node.js/Express backend proxy server.
- `server/routes/chatApi.ts` (or `server/routes/chatApi.js`) - Route handler for the `/api/chat` endpoint.
- `package.json` (root level) - To add backend dependencies (e.g., express, openai, express-rate-limit, dotenv).
- `src/components/ChatInterface.tsx` - To modify frontend API calls to point to the new proxy.
- `.env` (root level) - To store the `OPENAI_API_KEY` for the backend server (distinct from any VITE_ prefixed keys).
- `Procfile` or `vercel.json` (or similar) - For deployment configuration, if applicable.

### Notes

- The backend server should be a simple Node.js/Express application.
- The `OPENAI_API_KEY` for the backend must be stored securely as an environment variable on the server, not committed to Git.
- The frontend will no longer need direct access to any OpenAI API key.

### Tasks

- [x] 4.0 Setup Backend Proxy Server Environment
  - [x] 4.0.1 Create a `server` directory in the project root.
  - [x] 4.0.2 Initialize a new `package.json` within the `server` directory or add backend dependencies to the root `package.json`.
  - [x] 4.0.3 Install necessary backend dependencies: `express`, `openai` (for Node.js usage), `dotenv`, `cors`, `express-rate-limit`.
  - [x] 4.0.4 Create a basic Express server setup in `server/index.ts` (or `server.js`).
  - [x] 4.0.5 Configure the server to listen on a specific port (e.g., 3001 or as per deployment platform requirements).
  - [x] 4.0.6 Add a simple health check endpoint (e.g., `/health`) to verify the server is running.
  - [x] 4.0.7 Configure `cors` middleware to allow requests from your frontend's origin. (Currently permissive, allowing all origins for local development)

- [x] 4.1 Implement Core Proxy Logic
  - [x] 4.1.1 Create an API route for `/api/chat` (e.g., using Express Router).
  - [x] 4.1.2 The `/api/chat` endpoint should accept POST requests with a JSON body containing the user's message.
  - [x] 4.1.3 In the route handler, securely access the `OPENAI_API_KEY` from server-side environment variables (using `dotenv` for local development).
  - [x] 4.1.4 Initialize the OpenAI Node.js client within the route handler (or as a module-level instance if appropriate) using the server-side API key.
  - [x] 4.1.5 Construct the payload for the OpenAI Chat Completions API (messages array, model, etc.) based on the incoming request from the frontend.
  - [x] 4.1.6 Make the API call to OpenAI using the `openai.chat.completions.create()` method.
  - [x] 4.1.7 Handle the response from OpenAI: extract the assistant's message content.
  - [x] 4.1.8 Send the assistant's message back to the frontend as a JSON response.
  - [x] 4.1.9 Implement basic error handling for OpenAI API calls (e.g., log errors, return appropriate HTTP status codes).
  - [x] 4.1.10 Enhance backend to load and include user data (e.g., last 14 days) and system prompt in API calls to OpenAI.

- [x] 4.2 Integrate Basic Security Measures
  - [x] 4.2.1 Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is loaded via `dotenv` for local development and is configured as a proper environment variable for deployment.
  - [x] 4.2.2 Add `.env` file (containing `OPENAI_API_KEY`) to the root `.gitignore` file if not already present (to prevent committing the key). (Verified as complete)
  - [x] 4.2.3 Implement IP-based rate limiting on the `/api/chat` endpoint using `express-rate-limit`.
  - [x] 4.2.4 Configure a sensible rate limit (e.g., 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP) suitable for demo purposes.
  - [x] 4.2.5 Ensure rate limit exceeded responses are user-friendly or handled gracefully by the frontend. (Server returns JSON error)

- [x] 4.3 Refactor Frontend Application
  - [x] 4.3.1 Modify `src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`'s `handleSendMessage` (or `fetchOpenAIResponse` if abstracted).
  - [x] 4.3.2 Change the API call target from the direct OpenAI API to the new backend proxy endpoint (e.g., `fetch('/api/chat', ...)`).
  - [x] 4.3.3 Ensure the frontend sends the user's message in the expected JSON format to the proxy.
  - [x] 4.3.4 Ensure the frontend correctly processes the JSON response from the proxy.
  - [x] 4.3.5 Remove any direct usage of `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI calls from client-side code.
  - [x] 4.3.6 Remove the `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` option and potentially the direct `openai` client instantiation from `src/lib/openai_client.ts` if it's no longer used for client-side calls. (The file might still be used for type definitions).
  - [x] 4.3.7 Test error handling for proxy API failures on the frontend (e.g., display user-friendly messages).

- [ ] 4.4 Basic Deployment and Testing
  - [x] 4.4.1 Ensure both frontend and backend have necessary start scripts in package.json (e.g., `npm run dev` for frontend, `npm run server:dev` for backend). (Verified)
  - [x] 4.4.2 Perform end-to-end testing: Start both frontend and backend servers. Send messages through the UI and verify responses are proxied correctly. (User to verify)
  - [x] 4.4.3 Document how to run the application locally (both frontend and backend) in the README.
  - [x] 4.4.4 Configure build scripts for the backend (e.g., `npm run server:build`) and frontend (e.g., `npm run build`).
  - [x] 4.4.5 Ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is correctly set in the chosen deployment environment for the backend. (Noted for deployment)
  - [x] 4.4.6 Deploy the application to Netlify (frontend and backend function).
  - [x] 4.4.6.1 Push initial frontend code to GitHub for Netlify deployment.
  - [x] 4.4.6.2 Deploy frontend static site to Netlify.
  - [x] 4.4.6.3 Configure backend API as a Netlify Serverless Function.
  - [x] 4.4.6.4 Push Netlify Function configuration (`netlify.toml`, function code) to GitHub.
  - [x] 4.4.6.5 Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in Netlify site settings.
  - [x] 4.4.6.6 Verify backend function deployment and end-to-end functionality on Netlify.
  - [ ] 4.4.7 Conduct end-to-end testing on the deployed application.
  - [x] 4.4.8 Test rate limiting by sending multiple requests quickly (on deployed or local setup).
  - [x] 4.4.9 Verify error handling for both API errors and rate limit errors (on deployed or local setup).
  - [ ] 4.4.10 Ensure the application is shareable via a public URL (after deployment).
