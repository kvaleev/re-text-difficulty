## 6. Security - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system employs RBAC to manage user permissions, ensuring that users can only perform actions and access data appropriate to their roles and affiliations.

### 6.1. User Roles (Base Roles)

The system supports several base user roles, drawing concepts from foundational role definitions. These provide a primary level of access control:

- **Public User (Anonymous):**

  - **Description:** Any visitor to the portal who has not logged in.
  - **Permissions:**
    - Search and discover publicly available metadata.
    - View full details of publicly available metadata records.
    - Access general content pages (About, Contact, Documentation, etc.).

- **Registered User (Authenticated Basic User):**

  - **Display Name:** "Registered User"
  - **Description:** Users who have created an account and are logged in. This role provides basic authenticated access.
  - **Permissions:**
    - All permissions of a Public User.
    - Search and discover metadata.
    - View full details of metadata records they are permitted to see (public or organization-specific, if applicable, based on other potential roles).
    - Manage their own user profile (e.g., update contact information, change password).
    - (Future) Save searches, set preferences, or receive notifications.
  - **Note:** This role explicitly _does not_ have permissions to create, update, or delete metadata records. Such actions require more specialized roles (e.g., Metadata Creator, Node Officer).

- **Node Officer:**

  - **Display Name:** "Node Officer"
  - **Description:** Users responsible for managing metadata for their specific node/organization.
  - **Permissions (generally within their organizational context, as defined by the system's permission model):**
    - All permissions of a Registered User.
    - Create metadata for their organization.
    - Read, Update, and Delete metadata records belonging to their organization.
    - Manage user access (for `MetadataCreator`, `MetadataApprover` roles) within their organization (see Section 4.1).
    - View analytics and reports relevant to their organization's metadata.

- **System Administrator:**
  - **Display Name:** "System Administrator"
  - **Description:** Users with full access to all system functionalities and data.
  - **Permissions (as defined by the system's permission model):**
    - Create, Read, Update, and Delete any metadata record.
    - Create, Read, Update, and Delete any user account.
    - Manage all roles and permissions across the system.
    - Access and manage system-wide settings and configurations.
    - View comprehensive system-wide analytics and audit logs.
    - Perform all actions available to Node Officers and other roles.

### 6.2. Granular Permissions (Database Driven Conceptual Model)

The system's design includes support for a more granular, database-driven permission system, which can extend or override the base role permissions. This involves conceptual entities such as:

- **Permission Entity:**

  - Attributes: Unique name (e.g., "metadata:create", "user:delete"), description, action (e.g., "create", "read", "update", "delete", "manage"), subject (e.g., "metadata", "user", "settings", "organization"), conditions (for conditional logic, e.g., ownership, specific attributes).

- **Custom Role Entity:**

  - Attributes: Unique name, description, system flag (if it's a non-deletable system role).
  - Linked to users and role-permission associations.

- **Role-Permission Association:**

  - Links Custom Roles to Permissions, assigning specific permissions to custom roles.

- **User-Permission Association:**

  - Links Users directly to Permissions, allowing for overriding or granting specific permissions to individual users.
  - Attributes: Granted status (Boolean), expiration date (for temporary permissions).

- **Permission Grouping Entities:**
  - Allow grouping of permissions for easier management and assignment.

**RBAC Logic (Conceptual):**
A core permission-checking function is central to verifying user capabilities.

- Administrators generally have all permissions.
- The system checks if a user's assigned role (or roles) has the specified permission.
- Resource-based checks are included:
  - Users can typically access/modify their own resources (e.g., based on resource ownership).
  - Node Officers have broader access to resources within their own organization (e.g., based on organizational affiliation).

This dual system (base roles and granular permissions) allows for both simplicity for common cases and flexibility for specific needs. The granular system is intended for more advanced configurations or future enhancements.

### 6.3. Metadata Validation and Approval Workflow

A robust and structured workflow is essential to ensure the quality, consistency, and accuracy of metadata before it is published on the NGDI Portal. This workflow involves multiple stages, roles, and types of validation, operating primarily within the context of an organization contributing metadata, with oversight capabilities for System Administrators.

**Roles in the Workflow:**

- **Metadata Creator:** An individual (e.g., Node Officer, or a delegate within an organization) responsible for inputting, editing, and submitting metadata records.
- **Metadata Approver/Reviewer:** A designated individual or group within an organization responsible for reviewing submitted metadata against defined quality criteria and making an approval or rejection decision. This role requires subject matter expertise and understanding of metadata standards.
- **System (Automated Validation Tools):** Integrated tools that perform initial checks for schema compliance, structural integrity, and other predefined rules.
- **System Administrator:** Has oversight of the entire workflow, can manage configurations, and may intervene in exceptional cases.

**Workflow Stages:**

1.  **Creation & Submission:**

    - The `MetadataCreator` populates or updates a metadata record using the portal's interface.
    - The initial status of the record is typically "Draft" or "In Progress."
    - Upon completion, the `MetadataCreator` submits the record for approval. The status changes to "Pending Validation" or "Submitted for Review."

2.  **Automated Validation:**

    - Upon submission, the system automatically performs a series of validation checks:
      - **Schema Compliance:** Ensures the metadata record conforms to the defined metadata schema (e.g., correct fields, data types, mandatory elements).
      - **Structural Integrity:** Checks for well-formedness (e.g., valid XML/JSON if applicable).
      - **Link Validity:** Verifies that any URLs provided (e.g., for data access, documentation) are active and reachable.
      - **Controlled Vocabulary Adherence:** Checks if terms used in specific fields align with predefined lists or taxonomies.
    - Results of automated validation are logged. Minor, auto-correctable issues might be fixed, while significant errors may prevent progression to manual review, returning the record to the `MetadataCreator` with error reports.

3.  **Manual Review & Validation:**

    - If automated validation passes (or issues are flagged for manual attention), the metadata record moves to a queue for the designated `MetadataApprover(s)` within the organization.
    - The `MetadataApprover` conducts a comprehensive review focusing on:
      - **Content Accuracy:** Verifying that the metadata accurately and truthfully describes the geospatial dataset.
      - **Completeness:** Ensuring all relevant mandatory and important optional fields are filled with meaningful information.
      - **Clarity & Understandability:** Assessing if the abstract, purpose, and other descriptive fields are clear, concise, and understandable to the target audience.
      - **Consistency:** Checking for consistency with other metadata records from the organization and adherence to organizational guidelines.
      - **Fitness for Use:** Evaluating if the metadata provides sufficient information for a user to determine if the data is suitable for their needs.
      - **Compliance:** Ensuring adherence to any specific NGDI policies, data governance rules, or legal requirements (e.g., licensing, usage constraints).
    - Reviewers should use checklists and guidelines to ensure a consistent review process.

4.  **Decision & Feedback:**

    - Based on the review, the `MetadataApprover` makes one of the following decisions:
      - **Approve:** If the metadata meets all quality criteria.
        - The metadata status changes to "Approved" (and subsequently "Published," or directly to "Published" based on system configuration).
        - Approved metadata becomes discoverable through the portal as per its visibility settings.
      - **Reject (Return for Revision):** If the metadata fails to meet quality criteria.
        - The metadata status changes to "Needs Revision" or "Rejected."
        - The `MetadataApprover` _must_ provide specific, constructive feedback detailing the reasons for rejection and the required corrections. This feedback is crucial for the `MetadataCreator` to understand and address the issues.
      - **Escalate (Optional):** In complex cases or disputes, there might be a mechanism to escalate the review to another authority or a committee.

5.  **Revision (if Rejected):**

    - The `MetadataCreator` is notified of the rejection and receives the feedback.
    - They revise the metadata record to address the identified issues.
    - The `MetadataCreator` resubmits the revised metadata, and the workflow returns to Stage 2 (Automated Validation) or Stage 3 (Manual Review) as appropriate.

6.  **Publication:**
    - Once "Approved," the metadata record is published according to the portal's policies. This may be immediate or involve a final publishing step by a Node Officer or Administrator.

**Key Supporting Mechanisms:**

- **Notifications:** Automated notifications are sent to relevant users at each stage transition (e.g., submission confirmation, review assignment, approval/rejection notice).
- **Audit Trail:** All actions performed on a metadata record (creation, submission, validation checks, reviews, approvals, rejections, revisions, publication) are logged with user details, timestamps, and any associated comments or feedback. This provides a complete history for accountability and troubleshooting.
- **Status Tracking:** The portal provides a clear way for users to track the status of their submitted metadata records.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** The system may provide reports on metadata workflow performance, such as time taken for review, rejection rates, and common issues, to help identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

**Continuous Improvement:**

- The metadata validation and approval workflow itself should be periodically reviewed and refined based on feedback from users, analysis of workflow metrics, and evolving metadata standards or portal requirements.
- Training and documentation for `MetadataCreators` and `MetadataApprovers` should be regularly updated.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
  - Page load times should be within acceptable limits (e.g., < 3 seconds for key pages).
  - Search and filtering operations should be responsive, even with a large number of metadata records.
  - Database queries should be optimized (e.g., through appropriate indexing).
- **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a growing number of users, metadata records, and data requests.
- **Usability & Accessibility:**
  - Intuitive navigation and user interface.
  - Compliance with web accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).
  - Responsive design for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Reliability & Availability:** The portal should be highly available with minimal downtime. Implement robust error handling.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be well-structured, documented, and follow best practices to facilitate easy maintenance and updates. General good practices like using a monorepo structure, TypeScript, linters, and code formatters are beneficial.
- **Security:**
  - Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection).
  - Secure handling of sensitive data (user credentials, PII).
  - Regular security audits and updates.
  - HTTPS for all communications.
  - Consideration for API rate limiting, configurable via system settings.

## 8. Technical Considerations
