# ChoreHero - Video-First Cleaning Service Marketplace

## TL;DR
ChoreHero is a mobile marketplace connecting busy professionals with verified cleaners through video profiles, enabling trust-based 60-second bookings. It solves the trust barrier of letting strangers into homes while providing cleaners fair wages and flexible work.

## Elevator Pitch
"The Uber for cleaning services, but with video-first discovery - see exactly who's coming to clean your home before they arrive."

## Problem Statement
People need cleaning services but fear letting strangers into their homes. Current platforms use generic profiles and stock photos, creating anxiety about who will show up. Meanwhile, cleaners struggle with low platform wages and lack of direct customer relationships.

## Target Audience
**Primary**: Urban professionals (25-45) valuing time over money
**Secondary**: Verified cleaners seeking better wages and flexibility
**Tertiary**: Busy parents needing reliable household help

## USP
Video-first cleaner profiles with 30-second intros - building trust through transparency while maintaining the speed of on-demand booking.
