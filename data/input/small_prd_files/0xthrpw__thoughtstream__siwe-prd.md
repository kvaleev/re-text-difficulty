# Product Requirements Document: SIWE Authentication for Thoughtstream

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 30, 2025  
**Product:** Thoughtstream Notes Application  

## Product overview

### Document summary

This PRD outlines the implementation of Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) authentication for Thoughtstream, transforming it from a shared notes application into a user-specific, secure platform. The implementation will enable users to authenticate using their Ethereum wallets and access only their personal notes, while maintaining the existing lightweight and intuitive user experience.

### Product summary

Thoughtstream will integrate SIWE authentication to provide secure, decentralized user identification without requiring traditional username/password combinations. Users will connect their Ethereum wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) to access their personal note collection, ensuring privacy and data ownership while leveraging the existing React frontend and Node.js backend architecture.

## Goals

### Business goals

- **User privacy and security**: Implement secure authentication that protects user data and ensures note privacy
- **Decentralized identity adoption**: Position Thoughtstream as a Web3-native application leveraging blockchain technology for user authentication

- Handle wallet connection errors gracefully

**FR-003**: Session management
- Create and manage user sessions after successful authentication
- Implement session token generation and validation
- Provide session persistence across browser sessions

### Data isolation requirements (Priority: High)

**FR-004**: User-scoped note operations
- Filter all note operations by authenticated user's wallet address
- Prevent cross-user data access through API endpoints
- Maintain user association with existing notes during migration

**FR-005**: Backend authentication middleware
- Validate session tokens on protected endpoints
- Extract user identity from authenticated requests
- Implement proper error handling for authentication failures

### User experience requirements (Priority: Medium)

**FR-006**: Wallet connection UI
- Provide clear wallet connection buttons and status indicators
- Display connected wallet address in a user-friendly format
- Show connection status and allow disconnection

**FR-007**: Error handling and user feedback

- Provide guidance for users without supported wallets
- Handle network switching requirements

### Data migration requirements (Priority: Medium)

**FR-008**: Existing notes handling
- Provide administrative interface for associating existing notes with users
- Implement data migration strategy for pre-authentication notes
- Ensure no data loss during the authentication implementation

## User experience

### Entry points

**Primary entry point**: Web application landing page with prominent "Connect Wallet" button replacing the current direct access to notes.

**Wallet selection**: Modal or dedicated page for selecting wallet connection method (MetaMask, WalletConnect).

**Authentication flow**: SIWE message signing interface integrated with selected wallet provider.

### Core experience

**Wallet connection**: Users click "Connect Wallet" and select their preferred wallet provider. The application generates a SIWE message that users sign with their wallet. Upon successful verification, users gain access to their personal note collection.

**Note management**: After authentication, the existing tabbed interface remains unchanged. Users create, edit, and manage notes exactly as before, but now see only their personal notes.

**Session persistence**: Users remain authenticated across browser sessions until they explicitly disconnect or their session expires.

### Advanced features

**Address display**: Show shortened wallet address (0x1234...5678) in the header with option to copy full address.

**Network status**: Display current Ethereum network and warn users if they're on an unsupported network.

**Disconnect functionality**: Allow users to disconnect their wallet and clear their session.

### UI/UX highlights

**Minimal disruption**: Authentication layer adds security without changing the core note-taking experience.

**Clear status indicators**: Always visible wallet connection status and user identity.

**Progressive enhancement**: Existing users see improved security while new users get a secure-by-default experience.

## Narrative

As a knowledge worker who values privacy and data ownership, I want to securely access my personal notes using my Ethereum wallet so that I can maintain control over my data while enjoying a seamless note-taking experience. When I visit Thoughtstream, I connect my MetaMask wallet, sign a simple message to prove my identity, and immediately access my personal collection of notes. I can create, edit, and organize my thoughts knowing that only I can access this information, and I can access the same notes from any device by connecting the same wallet. The authentication process feels natural and aligns with my Web3 values while the note-taking experience remains fast and intuitive.

## Success metrics

### User-centric metrics

**Authentication success rate**: 95% of wallet connection attempts should complete successfully within 30 seconds.

**User retention**: 80% of users who successfully authenticate should return within 7 days.

**Session duration**: Average authenticated session should last at least 30 minutes.

**Error resolution**: Users experiencing connection errors should resolve them within 2 attempts 90% of the time.

### Business metrics

**User adoption**: 100% of active users should transition to authenticated access within 30 days of release.

**Data security incidents**: Zero unauthorized access incidents to user notes.

**Support requests**: Authentication-related support requests should not exceed 5% of total user interactions.

### Technical metrics

**Authentication latency**: SIWE verification should complete in under 2 seconds.

**Session token validation**: API response times should remain under 200ms with authentication middleware.

**System uptime**: Authentication service should maintain 99.9% uptime.

**Database queries**: User-scoped queries should maintain current performance levels.

## Technical considerations

### Integration points

**Frontend wallet integration**: Integration with Web3 provider libraries (ethers.js or wagmi) for wallet connection and message signing.

**Backend SIWE verification**: Integration with SIWE library for message parsing and signature verification.

**Session storage**: Redis-based session storage leveraging existing Redis infrastructure.

**API middleware**: Authentication middleware integration with existing Express.js route handlers.

### Data storage and privacy

**User identification**: Wallet addresses stored as lowercase hex strings for consistent user identification.

**Note association**: Existing Note interface already includes optional userId field, requiring population during migration.

**Session data**: Minimal session data storage including wallet address, session expiration, and session token.

**Redis schema updates**: 
- User sessions: `session:{token}` -> `{walletAddress, expiresAt}`
- User notes index: `user_notes:{walletAddress}` -> Set of note IDs
- Existing note storage remains unchanged with userId population

### Scalability and performance

**Session management**: Redis-based sessions support horizontal scaling and fast token validation.

**Database queries**: User-scoped queries will be more efficient than current global note queries.

**Wallet provider rate limits**: Implement request queuing and retry logic for wallet provider API calls.

**Concurrent authentication**: Support multiple simultaneous authentication attempts without conflicts.

### Potential challenges

**Wallet compatibility**: Different wallet providers may have varying SIWE implementation details requiring careful testing.

**Network switching**: Users on incorrect Ethereum networks will need clear guidance and error handling.

**Session security**: Proper token generation, storage, and validation to prevent session hijacking.

**Migration complexity**: Associating existing notes with users requires careful planning to prevent data loss.

**Gas fees**: While SIWE signing doesn't require gas, users may be confused about this distinction.
