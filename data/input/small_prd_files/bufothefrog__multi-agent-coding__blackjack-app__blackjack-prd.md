# Blackjack Card Counting Trainer - Product Requirements Document

**Target Platform:** Web (Next.js 14+)
**Primary Device:** Mobile-first
**Purpose:** Educational card counting trainer with multi-player simulation

---

## Product Vision

A comprehensive blackjack card counting trainer that teaches players the Hi-Lo counting system with full assistance, featuring realistic multi-player simulation to demonstrate the advantages of card counting in real casino scenarios.

### Core Value Proposition

**For card counting learners:**
- Full assistance with count overlays and strategy recommendations always visible
- Real-time explanations of count values and optimal decisions
- Practice in a realistic multi-player environment (3 NPC players)
- Learn card counting fundamentals without pressure

**What This Is NOT:**
- Not a real-money gambling application
- Not optimized for automated play or card counting software
- Not a complete casino simulation (no side bets, insurance optional, etc.)

---

## Technology Stack

**Framework:** Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- **100% client-side operation** - All game logic runs in the browser
- No server-side rendering for game components
- No backend API or database required

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- Custom casino theme
- Mobile-first responsive design

---

## Visual Design

**Casino Theme:** Modern luxury with emerald green felt, charcoal black background, gold accents
- Mobile-first responsive design (portrait primary, landscape supported)
- Touch-friendly interface with accessible controls

---

## Game Rules

**Standard Blackjack:**
- Objective: Get closer to 21 than dealer without busting
- Card values: 2-10 face value, J/Q/K = 10, Ace = 1 or 11
- Dealer hits on soft 17, stands on hard 17+
- Blackjack pays 3:2

**Player Actions:**
- **Hit:** Take another card
- **Stand:** Keep current hand
- **Double Down:** Double bet, take exactly one more card
- **Split:** Divide pairs into two hands (max 2 hands)
- **Surrender:** Forfeit half bet and end hand

**Deck Options:** 1, 2, 6, or 8 decks with appropriate penetration thresholds
- Reshuffle triggers reset running count

---

## Card Counting System: Hi-Lo

**Card Values:**
- Low Cards (2-6): +1
- Neutral Cards (7-9): 0
- High Cards (10, J, Q, K, A): -1

**Running Count (RC):**
- Cumulative count of all cards seen since last shuffle
- Display format: "RC +3" with color coding (green positive, red negative, gray neutral)
- Visible in Training/Learning modes, hidden by default in Testing mode

**True Count (TC):**
- Running count adjusted for remaining decks: TC = RC / decks remaining
- More important for betting decisions
- Example: RC +8 with 3 decks left = TC +3

**Deck Penetration:**
- Display approximate penetration in realistic buckets
- Visual: Stack of cards with red line showing position
- Updates after each hand

---

## NPC System

**Configuration:**
- 3 NPC players at table with user (4 total positions)
- All NPCs play simplified basic strategy (hit/stand only, no split/double)
- Always bet table minimum
- Decisions made automatically and instantly

**Purpose:**
- Demonstrates card counting value (more cards visible = better count accuracy)
- Simulates realistic casino environment
- Keeps player focused on their own strategy

---

## Learning System: Full Assistance Mode

**Training Mode (Always Active):**
- Count overlays (+1/0/-1) always visible on cards
- Running/True count always displayed with color coding
- Automatic strategy hints with recommended actions highlighted
- Count-based betting advice shown before each hand
- Deviation alerts when TC suggests strategy changes
- Real-time explanations of why certain plays are optimal
- No pressure, pure learning focus

**Features:**
- All assistance features enabled at all times
- Strategy recommendations based on both basic strategy and count
- Visual indicators for optimal decisions (green highlights)
- Detailed tooltips explaining card counting principles
- Session statistics tracked locally

---

## Strategy & Deviations

**Basic Strategy:**
- Mathematically optimal play without count information
- Covers hard totals, soft totals, pairs, and surrender decisions

**Count-Based Deviations (Key Examples):**
- Insurance: Take when TC ≥ +3
- 16 vs 10: Stand when TC ≥ 0
- 10 vs 10: Double when TC ≥ +4
- 12 vs 3: Stand when TC ≥ +2

**Display:**
- Automatically suggested when TC threshold reached
- Visual indicators show when deviation applies
- Tooltips explain the logic behind each deviation

---

## Betting & Bankroll

**Bankroll Management:**
- Starting: $1,000 (configurable)
- Table minimum: $5, $10, or $25 (configurable)
- Bankroll display color-coded (green = profit, red = losing)
- Bankruptcy handling with reset option

**Bet Spread (TC-Based):**
- TC ≤ 0: 1 unit
- TC +1: 1 unit
- TC +2: 2 units
- TC +3: 4 units
- TC +4: 6 units
- TC ≥ +5: 8 units

**Betting Interface:**
- Slider input with presets (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x)
- Recommended bet always highlighted based on True Count
- Visual indicator shows optimal bet spread
- Validation: min/max limits, bankroll check

---
