## 1. Executive Summary

### Product Overview
The Inventory Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to manage products, categories, and stock keeping units (SKUs) for businesses with thousands of products. The system provides robust inventory tracking, hierarchical category management, and advanced search capabilities through RESTful APIs.

### Key Objectives
- Provide efficient inventory tracking and management
- Support hierarchical category organization
- Enable flexible product and SKU management
- Ensure data integrity and business rule compliance
- Deliver high-performance search and filtering capabilities

### Target Users
- Inventory managers
- E-commerce administrators
- Warehouse staff
- System integrators

## 2. Business Requirements

### 2.1 Core Functionality

- **Unique Naming**: Category names must be unique with 255 character limit
- **Basic Attributes**: Name (required), description (optional), parent category (optional)

#### Product Management
- **Essential Attributes**: Name, description, brand, images, price, availability
- **Physical Attributes**: Weight, dimensions for shipping calculations
- **Identification**: SKU/Product ID for unique internal identification
- **Status Management**: Active, Inactive, Discontinued states
- **Category Assignment**: Every product must belong to an active category

#### SKU Management
- **Variant Tracking**: Color, size, weight, dimensions, and other differentiating attributes
- **Pricing**: Individual price per SKU variant
- **Inventory Levels**: Real-time stock quantity tracking
- **Status Management**: Active, Inactive, Out-of-stock states
- **Unique Identification**: Auto-generated SKU codes with manual override capability

### 2.2 Business Rules

#### Data Integrity Rules
- Every product must have at least one SKU
- Products must be assigned to active categories
- SKU codes must be unique across the system
- Category names must be unique
- Stock quantities cannot be negative

#### Category Deletion Rules
- Soft delete only - categories are marked as inactive
- When category is deleted:
  - Prevent deletion if active products are assigned, OR
  - Automatically unassign products (set category_id to NULL)
  - Require admin to reassign products to active categories

#### Inventory Rules
- Stock quantities must be non-negative integers
- Zero stock indicates "out of stock"
- Sales transactions cannot result in negative stock
- Support for reserved quantities (allocated but not shipped)

#### Price Validation
- Prices must be non-negative values

- **Scalability**: Handle thousands of products/SKUs efficiently
- **Concurrent Users**: Support multiple simultaneous search operations

## 5. Data Model Requirements

### 5.1 Category Entity
**Required Fields:**

- Status (active/deleted)

**Optional Fields:**
- Description
- Parent Category ID (for hierarchical structure)

### 5.2 Product Entity
**Required Fields:**
- Name
- Category ID (foreign key to active category)

**Optional Fields:**
- Description
- Brand
- Images
- Status (Active, Inactive, Discontinued)

### 5.3 SKU Entity
**Required Fields:**
- SKU Code/Identifier (unique)
- Product ID (foreign key)
- Price (non-negative)
- Stock Quantity (non-negative integer)
- Variant Attributes (color, size, weight, dimensions)

**Optional Fields:**
- Additional variant attributes

## 6. Validation & Error Handling

### 6.1 Validation Rules
- **String Lengths**: Enforce character limits (category name max 255)
- **Numeric Ranges**: Prices and stock quantities must be non-negative
- **Data Types**: Enforce correct data types (integers for quantity, decimals for price)
- **Referential Integrity**: Validate foreign key relationships
- **Business Rules**: Enforce SKU-product relationships, category assignments

### 6.2 Error Response Format
```json
{
  "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "One or more validation errors occurred.",
